        <h1>Visual Foreshadowing</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This assignment invites you to explore how filmmakers prepare their audience for significant moments
                through <strong>visual foreshadowing</strong>—using production design, cinematography, or editing to
                plant seeds that pay off later in the narrative. Using <em>Shoplifters</em> (2018) as our reference
                example, you will analyze how visual elements create the feeling of inevitability rather than surprise.
            </p>

            <h2>Throughline Example: Shoplifters (2018), Hirokazu Kore-eda</h2>

            <p><strong>The "I Should Have Seen That Coming" Moment</strong></p>
            <p>Great foreshadowing isn't a puzzle you're meant to solve in the moment; it's a feeling you can't shake.
                In <em>Shoplifters</em>, Kore-eda tells us the truth about this family from the very first frame, but
                we're too charmed to notice.</p>

            <p>Look at the house. It's not just messy—it's temporary. Things are piled up, not put away. Suitcases are
                often visible. The sleeping arrangements shift like tetris blocks. Visually, this is a transit station,
                not a home. The production design screams "impermanence" while the characters act out domestic
                stability.</p>

            <p>Then there's the framing. Kore-eda loves to shoot through things. Doorways, racks of clothes, windows. He
                constantly puts barriers between us and the characters, suggesting that there is something hidden,
                something we aren't being shown. It creates a subtle, subconscious tension. We feel like voyeurs spying
                on a secret, which turns out to be exactly what we are.</p>

            <p>When the reveal finally drops—that they are strangers bound by crime, not blood—it doesn't feel like a
                cheap twist. It feels inevitable. We look back and realize the visual language was telling us the truth
                the entire time.</p>

            <h3>Key Visual Cues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Clutter of Transience:</strong> The set design emphasizes portability and lack of
                    ownership, hinting that this arrangement could dissolve in an instant.</li>
                <li><strong>Obstructed Views:</strong> Shooting through layers of foreground objects visually reinforces
                    the theme of hiding and secrets.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual as Performance:</strong> Watch how they perform family roles (eating together, hair
                    cutting) a little <em>too</em> deliberately, visually signaling that they are playing house rather
                    than living it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Films to Choose From</h2>
            <p>Analyze visual foreshadowing techniques in a scene from one of these films:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Spirited Away</em>, Hayao Miyazaki</li>
                <li><em>Your Name</em>, Makoto Shinkai</li>
                <li><em>Akira</em>, Katsuhiro Ôtomo</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Prompts</h2>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 1: Design Clues</span>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Find the warning signs in the set.</p>
                <p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What object or environment is telling us a secret?</li>
                    <li>Is it hidden in the background or right in our face?</li>
                    <li>How does the meaning of this object change after you know the ending?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In <em>Shoplifters</em>, the messy, shifting sleeping arrangements tell us
                    "this is temporary" long before the script admits it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 2: Camera Secrets</span>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyze how the camera hides the truth.</p>
                <p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the camera looking <em>through</em> something? Why?</li>
                    <li>Does the framing hide a character's face or reaction?</li>
                    <li>Do we keep seeing the same shot? What is it trying to tell us?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Kore-eda shoots through doorframes and laundry. He's visually telling us
                    "you are not seeing the whole picture."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 3: The Edit</span>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> See what was cut out.</p>
                <p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the scene end before we expect it to?</li>
                    <li>Are we missing a key reaction?</li>
                    <li>Is there a sound or color that warns us something is coming?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Cutting away before a question is answered is a classic way to make the
                    audience lean in. We know we missed something.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Textbook Contribution</h2>
            <p>We want analyses that make us say "I should have seen that." Don't just list examples. Explain how they
                work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Setup:</strong> How was the seed planted?</li>
                <li><strong>The Camouflage:</strong> How did the film hide it in plain sight?</li>
                <li><strong>The Payoff:</strong> How did it bloom?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length:</strong> 500+ words.</li>
                <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> MLA style.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Terms:</strong> Foreshadowing, motif, composition, irony.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Show us the invisible thread connecting the beginning to the end.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Insight:</strong> Did you spot something subtle?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument:</strong> Does your evidence support your claim?</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Is the writing clear and professional?</li>
            </ul>
