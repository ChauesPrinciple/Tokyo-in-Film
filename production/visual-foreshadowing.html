        <h1>Visual Foreshadowing</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This assignment asks you to analyze how cinematographers use <strong>visual foreshadowing</strong>—the
                subtle
                planting of visual cues that hint at future narrative developments. Using <em>Shoplifters</em> (2018)
                as our reference example, you will examine how composition, lighting, and symbolism prepare the audience
                for the truth long before it is spoken.</p>

            <h2>Throughline Example: Shoplifters (2018), Hirokazu Kore-eda</h2>
            <p><strong>The Seed</strong></p>
            <p>Think of visual foreshadowing as planting a seed. In <em>Shoplifters</em>, Kore-eda plants the seed of
                the
                family's fragility in the very first scenes. We see them crammed into a tiny, cluttered apartment. The
                framing is tight, almost suffocating. They are constantly overlapping each other in the frame, limbs
                entangled, visually inseparable. It looks like intimacy.</p>

            <p>But look closer. The camera rarely shoots them from the outside world looking in. We are trapped inside
                with them. The "invisible" nature of their existence is foreshadowed by how the camera hides them behind
                objects, in shadows, and in the margins of the frame. They are visually erasing themselves from society.
            </p>

            <p>The payoff comes when the family is caught. Suddenly, the visual language shifts. We see them in bleak,
                sterile interrogation rooms. They are isolated in the center of the frame, separated by vast negative
                space. The "clutter" of their love is gone, replaced by the cold emptiness of the law. The visual seed
                of their isolation finally blooms into the narrative reality.</p>

            <h3>How it Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Seed (The Clue):</strong> The claustrophobic framing creates a sense of a "secret world"
                    that cannot last.</li>
                <li><strong>The Growth (The Pattern):</strong> Repeated shots of hands touching and exchanging objects
                    (food, stolen goods) establish transaction as their love language.</li>
                <li><strong>The Bloom (The Reveal):</strong> The stark separation in the finale confirms that their
                    connection was fragile and dependent on their shared secrecy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Films to Choose From</h2>
            <p>Analyze visual foreshadowing in a scene from one of these films:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Spirited Away</em>, Hayao Miyazaki (The tunnel, the food)</li>
                <li><em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, Kentarō Hagiwara (Reflections, masks)</li>
                <li><em>Pale Flower</em>, Masahiro Shinoda (Shadows, cards)</li>
                <li><em>Parasite</em> (if applicable to course context, otherwise <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> for the
                    water motifs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Note: Stick to the course list. Godzilla Minus One is a great option for visual cues regarding the
                    water.</em></p>

            <h2>Prompts</h2>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 1: The Seed (The Clue)</span>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Identify the first visual hint.</p>
                <p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What object or framing choice seems out of place initially?</li>
                    <li>Does the camera linger on something "unimportant"?</li>
                    <li>How does the lighting tell you this situation is unsafe or temporary?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In <em>Shoplifters</em>, the scars on the little girl's arm are shown
                    briefly, establishing the trauma that binds the family together before it is discussed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 2: The Pattern (The Growth)</span>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Track the motif across the film.</p>
                <p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the visual cue return? Does it change?</li>
                    <li>Is the motif associated with a specific character or emotion?</li>
                    <li>How does the director use repetition to train your eye?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Kore-eda repeatedly frames the family eating together. The food is stolen,
                    but the joy is real. The visual pattern equates "crime" with "sustenance."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 3: The Bloom (The Reveal)</span>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyze the moment the meaning becomes clear.</p>
                <p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How does the final scene re-contextualize the earlier images?</li>
                    <li>Do you see the "Seed" differently now that you know the truth?</li>
                    <li>How does the visual language shift to confirm the change?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The final shot of the boy looking out of the bus. He is framed alone. We
                    realize the clutter of the house wasn't just poverty; it was his only shield.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Textbook Contribution</h2>
            <p>If your analysis uncovers a hidden visual language, we'll feature it. Show us the code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Visual Code:</strong> What was the symbol?</li>
                <li><strong>The Translation:</strong> What did it mean?</li>
                <li><strong>The Effect:</strong> How did it enhance the story?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length:</strong> 500+ words. Focus on the image.</li>
                <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> MLA style. Include timestamps for visual cues.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Terms:</strong> Use the language of the course (motif, composition, foreshadowing).</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Teach us to see what we missed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Did you spot a subtle detail?</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Did you explain <em>why</em> it matters?</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Is your description of the shot accurate?</li>
                <li><strong>Polish:</strong> Is it professional?</li>
            </ul>
