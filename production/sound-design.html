            <p>Just listen for a moment.</p>

            <p>What do you hear?</p>
            <p>Maybe you’re in a coffee shop, surrounded by the bustle of other customers, the busywork of baristas, and
                the sound of the city just outside. Maybe you’re in your room, a dog barking in the distance outside,
                cars passing, music playing in the background, maybe even the television. (Which, frankly, is just rude.
                I expect your undivided attention!) Maybe you’re alone in the library. It’s quiet. But is it really?
                Distant footsteps among the stacks. The hum of the air conditioning…</p>
            <p>You are surrounded by sound unless you’re reading this in a sensory deprivation chamber. The soundscape
                around us shapes our understanding of the world, becoming its own meaningful context for every other
                sense perception. Most of the time, it barely registers; we don’t attend to it unless we are listening
                for something in particular. But take it away, and we feel lost, vulnerable, and disoriented.</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, sound provides an equally meaningful context for cinema. Or at least, it shouldn’t be
                surprising. But then again, it wasn’t until 1927 that Sam Warner figured out how to marry sound and
                image in <em>The Jazz Singer</em>, the first film with synchronized dialogue. Before that, no one cared
                that cinema was a purely visual medium. And as Sam toiled away at the new technology, most of the other
                movie moguls in Hollywood assumed it was a passing fad. That no one really wanted to <em>hear</em> the
                actors talking.</p>
            <p>In the century or so since they were all proven wrong, sound has become <strong>co-expressive
                </strong>with cinematography; that is, it shapes how we see what’s on screen, just as the images we see
                influence how we perceive the sounds.</p>

            <p>Just listen to how French filmmaker Agnès Varda has used sound and image together over the last
                half-century:</p>

            <p>Like cinematography, sound recording and reproduction have increased in sophistication and technical
                complexity, developing their own important contribution to cinematic language along the way. So much so
                that when we talk about the use of sound in cinema, we talk about it in terms of <strong>sound
                    design</strong>, a detailed plan for the immersive effects of a motion picture’s soundscape that
                begins in pre-production before a single frame is shot and extends to the very end of post-production,
                often the final element in the entire process</p>

            <h2>2.4.1 Production Sound</h2>

            <p>Before we get to how that soundscape is shaped in the post-production process, let’s look at how (and
                what) sound is recorded during production. The <strong>production sound department</strong> is made up
                of several specialists dedicated to recording clean sound on set as the camera rolls. They include the
                on-set <strong>location sound recordist </strong>or <strong>location sound mixer,</strong> who oversees
                the recording of on-set sound and mixes the various sources in real-time during production; boom<strong>
                    operators</strong>, who hold microphones on long poles to pick up dialogue as close to actors as
                possible without being seen on camera (it helps if they are very tall and relatively strong, those poles
                get heavy after a while), and <strong>assistant sound technicians</strong>, responsible for organizing
                the equipment and generally assisting the sound mixer.</p>
            <p>And just like the camera department, the sound department has its own set of specialized equipment to
                make their work possible. Obviously, there are <strong>microphones</strong> involved. But sound
                recordists can be as particular about their microphones, what brand, type, and technology as
                cinematographers are about their cameras. Microphones can be omnidirectional or directional, cardioid or
                super-cardioid, mono or stereo, and each one will pick up sounds in a distinctly different way. You can
                use a shotgun mic on a boom pole to target a sound source from a reasonable distance with a shielded
                cable. Or you can use a tiny Lavalier mic taped to the collar of an actor that sends an audio signal
                wirelessly to the recorder. Or you can use all of the above in an endless number of configurations, all
                feeding into the same field mixer for the recordist to monitor and record.</p>
            <p>Now you may be wondering, isn’t there a microphone right there on the camera? Why not just use that and
                save all that headache?</p>
            <p>First of all, if you asked that out loud, every sound recordist in the universe just collectively
                screamed in agony. Second, they’re all so upset because cameras are designed to record an image, not
                sound. And while they may have a relatively cheap omnidirectional microphone built-in or even inputs for
                higher-quality microphones, nothing can replace the trained ears of a location sound mixer precisely
                controlling the various streams of audio into equipment designed to do just that. This is why, even now,
                most cinema uses <strong>dual-system</strong> <strong>recording</strong>, that is, recording sound
                <em>separate </em>from the image during production.
            </p>
            <p>Dual-system recording allows for more precise control over the location sound, but it also comes with its
                own problem: synchronization. If the sound is recorded separately from the image, how do you sync them
                up when you’re ready to edit? Glad you asked. Ever seen one of these:</p>

                <figcaption class="mt-align-center">The Slate.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>We have lots of names for it: clapper, sticks, sound marker, but the most common is
                <strong>slate</strong>, based on the fact that in the early days, it was made out of slate, the same
                stuff they used to make chalkboards. It serves two purposes. The first is to visually mark the beginning
                of each take with the key details of the production as well as the scene, shot, and take number. This
                comes in handy for the editor as they are combing through all of the footage in post-production. The
                second is to set a mark for sound synchronization. A crew member, usually the second camera assistant,
                holds the slate in front of the camera and near a microphone and verbally counts off the scene, shoots
                and takes a number, and then SLAPS the slate closed. In post-production, the editors, usually an
                assistant editor (cause, let’s face it, this is tedious work), can line up the exact frame where the
                slate closes with the exact moment the SLAP is recorded on the microphone. After that, the rest of the
                shot is synchronized.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, this whole process, repeated for every take during production, is a kind of call-and-response
                ritual:</p>
            <p><strong>1st Assistant Director</strong>: “Quiet on the set! Roll sound!”</p>
            <p><strong>Sound mixer</strong>: “Sound speed!”</p>
            <p><strong>1st AD</strong>: “Roll camera!”</p>
            <p><strong>Cinematographer</strong>: “Rolling!”</p>
            <p><strong>2nd Assistant Camera</strong>: “Scene 1 Apple Take 1” SLAP!</p>
            <p><strong>Cinematographer</strong>: “Hold for focus. Camera set!”</p>
            <p><strong>Director</strong>: “And… ACTION!”</p>
            <p>Every. Single. Time. And note that the 2nd AC mentions scene number 1, the shot, Apple (for shot “A” of
                scene 1), and take number 1.</p>
            <p>But wait… sound speed? That’s another of those little anachronisms of cinema. For much of cinema sound
                history, the sound was recorded onto magnetic tape on a clunky reel-to-reel recorder. It would take a
                moment for the recorder to get up to “speed” once the recordist hit record, so everyone would have to
                wait until they called out “sound speed!” We use digital recording these days with no lag time at all,
                but the ritual never changed.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, 2nd ACs can have a lot of fun with this little ritual. Check out Geraldine Brezca’s spin on
                the tradition throughout Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Inglorious Basterds </em>(2009):</p>

            <p>Now that we have a sense of <em>how</em> things get recorded on set during production, we should probably
                cover <em>what</em> gets recorded. The answer: not much. Or at least a lot less than you might think. In
                fact, the focus of on-set recording is really just clean dialogue. That’s it. Everything else,
                background sounds, birds chirping, music on a radio, and even footsteps, are almost always recorded
                <em>after</em> production. The main job of location sound recordists is to isolate dialogue and shut out
                every other sound.
            </p>
            <p>Why? Because sound editors, the folks who take over from the recordists during post-production, want to
                control <em>everything</em>. Remember how nothing is on screen by accident? The same goes for sound.
                Clean dialogue has to match the performance we see on screen, but everything else can be shaped to serve
                the story by layering in one sound at a time.</p>
            <p>There is one exception. Another little ritual everyone gets used to on a set. At the end of a scene, when
                all of the shots are done, the location sound recordist will whisper to the 1st AD, and the 1st AD will
                call out: “Hold for room tone!” And then everyone stops in their tracks and holds still, remaining
                completely silent for at least 60 seconds.</p>
            <p>It’s awkward:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget118"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uSjo8AMvXc" title="Living in Oblivion (room tone)"

            <p>But what is <strong>room tone</strong>? Every space, interior or exterior, has its own unique, underlying
                ambient sound. What we sometimes call a <strong>sound floor</strong>. During production, as the actors
                deliver their lines, the microphones pick up this sound floor along with the dialogue. But in
                post-production, as the editors pick and choose the takes they want to use, there will inevitably be
                gaps in the audio, moments of dead air. Room tone recordings can be used to fill in those gaps and match
                the sound floor of the recorded dialogue.</p>
            <p>Of course, as I mentioned, it can be a bit awkward. But it can also be kind of beautiful in its own way:
            </p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">

            <p>Room tone is just another example of how <strong>sound editors</strong> control every aspect of the sound
                in the cinematic experience.</p>
