        <h1>Cinematography (On Set)</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">

            <div class="art-banner-wrap">&nbsp;</div>
            <p>If <em>mise-en-scène</em> sets the blueprint for the visual language of a film, cinematography is where
                that vision comes to life. It’s not just about capturing what’s happening in front of the camera but
                about shaping how we see it. Through careful decisions about framing, movement, and lighting,
                cinematography transforms a static design into something dynamic and alive, guiding our emotions and our
                attention across the screen.</p>
            <p>Consider Junta Yamaguchi’s <em>Beyond the Two Infinite Minutes</em>. A film that plays with the concept
                of time travel within a single confined space could easily feel visually repetitive, but Yamaguchi’s
                cinematography keeps it fresh and engaging. Shot to look like one continuous take, the film’s carefully
                choreographed camera work pulls us directly into the loop alongside the characters. By following them in
                real-time as they race up and down stairs and peer into screens, the cinematography builds tension and
                urgency while maintaining the playfulness that defines the film. It’s an example of how thoughtful,
                precise camera movement can make even a small, contained story feel expansive and alive.</p>
            <p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have films like <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</em>, which use
                cinematography to capture the thrill of motion on a much grander scale. In a film where cars tear
                through the streets of Tokyo at breakneck speed, the camera becomes as much a part of the action as the
                drivers themselves. Low angles emphasize the power and speed of the vehicles, while sweeping crane shots
                and rapid tracking shots pull us into the chaos and exhilaration of the races. Here, cinematography
                doesn’t just show the action; it makes us <em>feel</em> it.</p>
            <p>And then there’s a quieter approach, like that seen in <em>Adrift in Tokyo</em>. Satoshi Miki’s film
                focuses less on flashy camera tricks and more on composition, framing the bustling city streets of Tokyo
                as both a backdrop and a character in its own right. Static shots linger on moments of stillness or
                quiet humor as the characters wander aimlessly through their surroundings. By letting the visuals
                breathe, Miki uses cinematography to highlight not just the characters’ emotional journey but the unique
                rhythm and texture of the city itself.</p>
            <p>Now that we’ve laid the foundation for visual storytelling, let’s dive deeper into the tools of
                cinematography—exploring how light, framing, and movement are executed during production to shape the
                look and feel of a film. Whether it’s a simple stroll through Tokyo or a dizzying time loop, this is
                where the magic happens—one frame at a time.</p>



            <p><strong>Composition</strong>, the arrangement of people, objects, and settings within the frame of an
                image, has already come up a few times in previous chapters. That’s because how a cinematographer
                composes the image, how they <em>design </em>each shot, is one of the most important elements in
                cinematic storytelling. How those people, objects, and settings are arranged within the border of the
                image can bring balance or imbalance, reveal or hide information, indicate power or weakness, all
                without a word of dialog, an edit, or even a character on the screen.</p>
            <p>But before a cinematographer can start to think about how to properly compose a shot, they have one more
                decision to make: the shape of their frame. Okay, every frame (for now) is some variation on a
                rectangle. But the proportions of that rectangle will dictate how people, objects, and settings are
                arranged within it. This is known as the <strong>aspect ratio</strong>, the width of the frame relative
                to its height. The current standard for motion pictures is 16:9, or 1.78:1, a rectangle that is almost
                twice as wide as it is tall. But in the early days of cinema, the standard was much closer to a square,
                4:3, sometimes called the <strong>academy ratio</strong>. And sometimes filmmakers opt for a much wider
                frame, as wide as 2.35:1. That aspect ratio is a particular favorite of Quentin Tarantino. Whatever
                aspect ratio a filmmaker chooses will affect the choices they make regarding composition. Check out this
                quick comparison:</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center"><u><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/aspect-ratio.jpg"><img
                            alt="aspect ratio"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156767/aspect-ratio.jpg"
                            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></a></u></p>

            <p>Once a filmmaker has chosen their aspect ratio, the most basic starting point for composition, one we all
                intuitively understand from our own experience snapping photos with our phones, is balance. Images that
                are well-balanced use the space within the frame to evenly distribute visual interest, creating a
                proportional, pleasing composition. (Unless that’s not what you’re going for, but we’ll get to that).
                One way to achieve that balance is the <strong>rule of thirds</strong>. The idea is to divide the frame
                into thirds horizontally and vertically and line up areas of visual interest at the intersection of
                those points. Here’s an example:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;"><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/Ruleofthirds4-scaled.jpg"><img
                            alt="I" height="100%"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156768/Ruleofthirds4-scaled.jpg"
                            style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="100%" /> </a></div>
            </div>

            <p>By arranging the actors along the intersection of the grid lines, the composition feels well-balanced and
                proportional. It has the added benefit of helping to tell the story, where the two characters share the
                screen as equals.</p>
            <p>Now take a look at another image from the same film:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;"><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/Ruleofthirds3-scaled.jpg"><img
                            alt="i" height="100%"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156769/Ruleofthirds3-scaled.jpg"
                            style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="100%" /> </a></div>
            </div>

            <p>In this composition, the subjects are still evenly distributed within the frame, but the relative size
                difference between the characters indicates an unequal power dynamic. Again, helping to tell the story.
            </p>
            <p>The rule of thirds is all about balance and proportion in the composition, to bring a sense of symmetry
                to the image. Some filmmakers take this notion of symmetry in composition to the extreme. Check out this
                supercut of Wes Anderson’s apparent obsession with symmetry in his films:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">
                    <iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""
                        src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/89302848"
                        style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;"
                        title="Vimeo video player"></iframe>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>This consistent use of balanced composition is one of the elements that makes a Wes Anderson film a Wes
                Anderson film. That pattern in his framing is part of his signature mise-en-scéne.</p>
            <p>But just like three-point lighting, the rule of thirds is really just a starting point for understanding
                how composition can be used to help tell a cinematic story. Framing the shot is really about directing
                our attention, showing us where to look in the shot or scene, and ultimately, how to <em>feel</em> about
                it. There are lots of ways to do this.</p>
            <p>Take a look at how Nicholas Winding Refn uses another way to divide up the frame, a quadrant approach, to
                direct our attention in a given shot or sequence:</p>

            <p>Or how Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa combines framing and movement to constantly redefine
                relationships and motivations using simple geometry:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

            <p>Sometimes a filmmaker will direct our attention by framing the subject <em>within</em> another frame in
                the composition. Check out how Wong Kar-Wai uses this technique in the stunning romance <em>In the Mood
                    for Love</em> (2000):</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

            <p>All of these examples demonstrate how filmmakers use framing to direct our attention and help tell the
                story. As discussed in Chapter Two, these techniques contribute to our shared cinematic language as
                filmmakers <em>and </em>viewers. Some of the more obvious ways filmmakers employ framing as a form of
                communication is by using imagery we already intuitively understand from our everyday lives. Take, for
                example, the apparent proximity of the subject to the camera. As discussed in Chapter Two, a
                <strong>close-up </strong>creates a sense of intimacy with the subject, just like it would in real life
                if we stood within inches of another person (hopefully with their permission, because if not, that’s
                just creepy). If the subject appears far away, as in an <strong>extreme</strong> <strong>long
                    shot</strong>, that communicates a sense of disconnection or <em>emotional</em> distance from the
                subject. In fact, directors and cinematographers have a convenient shorthand for how close or far away
                the subject should appear, a code for where to place the camera (or what focal length to use). A
                close-up and extreme long shot is obvious enough. But there is also the <strong>extreme
                    close-up</strong>, <strong>medium close-up</strong>, <strong>medium shot</strong>, <strong>medium
                    long</strong>, <strong>long, </strong>etc. Each term means something specific in terms of
                composition. A medium-long shot, for example, will typically compose a character from the knees up. A
                medium shot will be from the waist up. Having a specific term for a specific composition saves time (and
                money) on the set during production.
            </p>
            <p>Another way filmmakers can communicate through composition using imagery we already intuitively
                understand is by adjusting the angle of view. If a cinematographer frames the shot below the eyeline of
                a character – so we are literally looking up to them – that character will feel dominant and powerful.
                Frame the subject in profile, and the character will feel a bit more mysterious, leaving us wanting to
                know more about them.</p>
            <p>A filmmaker can also “break” the rules of balance and proportion for a desired effect. For example, if a
                cinematographer intentionally creates an asymmetrical, unbalanced image, it will likewise make the
                viewer feel uneasy and off balance. Or they can compose the image so the main subject is isolated and
                small relative to the rest of the frame, creating what is known as <strong>negative space</strong>. This
                can help communicate a character’s isolation or powerlessness in a scene.</p>

            <p>Much of the above discussion about composition is as true for still photography and painting as it is for
                cinematography. But what makes cinema special is, of course, <strong>movement</strong>, both in terms of
                how subjects move within the frame – also known as <strong>blocking</strong> – and how the frame itself
                moves through a scene. While the blocking of actors in a scene is important, I want to focus on how a
                cinematographer can move their camera within a single shot to reframe an image and potentially change
                the meaning of the scene.</p>
            <p>There are many different ways a camera can move. Let’s take a look at some of the simplest, starting with
                <strong>pans</strong> and <strong>tilts</strong>. A tilt is simply moving the camera up or down from a
                fixed point, usually a tripod. A pan is simply rotating the camera from side to side, also from a fixed
                point. Here’s an example of a pan:

            <p>The effect is the same as if you simply turned your head from left to right, keeping your eyes straight
                ahead. But by moving the frame, the cinematographer is able to radically reorient our point of view
                while also creating a sense of anticipation as to what will be revealed.</p>
            <p>But if you want the camera to actually move through the space, not simply move left to right or up and
                down, there are a few options. You could just pick it up and move it. That’s called, appropriately
                enough, a <strong>handheld shot</strong>. But if you want that movement to be more subtle, or at least a
                lot smoother, you’ll want more precise control over how the camera moves. One way to achieve that is to
                put it on wheels. Sometimes, those wheels are stuck on a track that grips have laid down for a
                particular shot, and sometimes, they’re just well-oiled wheels that will go wherever the grip pushes
                them. Either way, this is called a <strong>dolly shot</strong>. Dolly shots come in all sorts of
                flavors. You can <strong>dolly in</strong> or <strong>dolly out</strong>, that is, move toward or away
                from a stationary subject. Here’s an example of a dolly out combined with a tilt:</p>

            <p>you can set up a <strong>tracking shot</strong> that tracks along with a subject in motion (and may or
                may not be on actual tracks). Here’s a simple tracking shot of two kids on their bicycles:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

            </div>

            <p>In this case, the camera was mounted on the back of a van, tracking in front of the subjects and leading
                them forward. Notice too, how towards the end of the shot, the camera shifts subtly to reframe the image
                of just the girl, indicating a subtle shift in emphasis in the story.</p>
            <p>You can also put the camera on a crane to achieve a really dramatic shift in the point of view, like this
                <strong>crane shot</strong> from <em>High Noon</em> (1952, Fred Zinneman, dir.):

            <p>Notice how effective this shift in perspective is in making the character seem isolated, small, and
                powerless without even knowing the context or the rest of the story (it’s an amazing film, and you
                should go watch it right now).</p>
            <p>If you want the freedom of physically carrying the camera around through a scene but still want the
                smooth motion of a dolly, you can use a special rig called a <strong>Steadicam</strong>. Steadicam is
                actually a brand name for a camera stabilizer that has become a somewhat generic term (like Kleenex or
                Xerox… does anyone still say Xerox?). The camera is strapped to the camera operator using a system of
                counterweights, gimbals, and gyroscopes (it feels like I’m making those words up, but I’m not):</p>

            <p>The result is incredibly smooth motion regardless of terrain.</p>
            <p>Here’s one of the most famous Steadicam shots in cinema history from Martin Scorsese’s
                <em>Goodfellas</em> (1990):

            <p>Try following those two actors through all of that with a camera on wheels!</p>
            <p>Pans, tilts, dollies, cranes, and steadicams, regardless of how a filmmaker moves the camera, one
                question they must always answer first is: Why move the camera at all? That is, is the movement
                <strong>motivated</strong>? In the case of Scorsese’s Steadicam shot above, we’re following the main
                characters into a nightclub. Motivation enough to move with them. Or that crane shot from <em>High Noon;
                    the</em> move reveals something important about the character. Again, solid motivation. But what
                happens when a camera move is <em>un</em>motivated? If the camera moves simply because the filmmaker
                thinks it “looks cool”? (I’m looking at you, <u><a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPtHPgZmZdA">Michael Bay</a></u>). Most often, an
                unmotivated camera move that isn’t serving the story reminds the viewer they are watching a movie. The
                move becomes <em>visible</em> instead of <em>invisible</em>, and usually, that’s the last thing a
                filmmaker wants. All of this is supposed to be invisible, remember?
            </p>
            <p>But sometimes, a filmmaker intentionally moves the camera without clear motivation to achieve a certain
                effect. For example, a tracking shot can move laterally through a scene with or without subjects in
                motion. Since there is no <em>reason</em> to move the camera, the movement can feel unmotivated and,
                therefore, more <em>noticeable </em>to the viewer. So why do it? Here’s a deep dive into how effective a
                lateral tracking shot can be:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

            </div>

            <p>Maybe the best example of a really effective but completely unmotivated camera movement is one of
                filmmaker Spike Lee’s signature camera moves: The Spike Lee Dolly. At least once in every film, Spike
                Lee will put one or more characters on the same dolly as the camera and move them <em>both</em> through
                the scene. It’s disorienting and a little bizarre, but it creates a fascinating image that can draw the
                viewer into the psychology of the character:</p>

            <p>Well-planned and thoughtful camera movement, usually the motivated kind, can not only help tell the
                story, but it can also radically transform our relationship to the story. It doesn’t always have to be
                flashy. It could just be a subtle shift in perspective. A slight pan or a minute push in on a dolly. But
                it can change everything:</p>

            <p>The last point I’d like to make regarding cinematography is how really great cinematographers can combine
                <em>all </em>of the above into one continuous bravura shot that manages to move the story forward
                without a single edit. Don’t get me wrong, editing is important, and we’ll get to that next. But
                sometimes, a filmmaker finds a way to move through a scene, choreographing the actors and the camera
                department in such a way that the story unfolds in one long, continuous take. And it can be
                breathtaking.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, the shot above from <em>Goodfellas</em> is a pretty good example. Notice how Scorsese moves the
                camera through several different settings without ever needing to cut away from the shot. But the most
                famous <strong>long take</strong> is probably Orson Welles’s opening shot from <em>Touch of Evil</em>
                (1958). Seriously, check this out:</p>

            <p>Imagine the planning required to choreograph that sequence. Everything had to work like clockwork (pun
                intended). And yet, nothing was sacrificed in terms of cinematic storytelling. Welles is able to move in
                and out of close-ups, medium shots and long shots, overhead crane shots and smooth tracking shots,
                directing our attention, revealing information and creating suspense. All without a single cut.</p>
            <p>Now check out how filmmakers like Sam Mendes are still imitating that iconic shot in films like
                <em>Spectre</em> (2015):

            <p>Sometimes these long takes are much less noticeable. Take a look at how a filmmaker like Steven
                Spielberg, not necessarily known for bravura camera moves, still finds ways to use the occasional long
                take to serve the story:</p>
