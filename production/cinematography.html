        <div class="textbook-content">

            <div class="art-banner-wrap">&nbsp;</div>
            <p>If <em>mise-en-scène</em> sets the blueprint for the visual language of a film, cinematography is
                where
                that vision comes to life. It’s not just about capturing what’s happening in front of the
                camera but
                about shaping how we see it. Through careful decisions about framing, movement, and lighting,
                cinematography transforms a static design into something dynamic and alive, guiding our emotions and our
                attention across the screen.</p>
            <p>Consider Junta Yamaguchis <em>Beyond the Two Infinite Minutes</em>. A film that plays with the concept
                of time travel within a single confined space could easily feel visually repetitive, but Yamaguchis
                cinematography keeps it fresh and engaging. Shot to look like one continuous take, the films
                carefully
                choreographed camera work pulls us directly into the loop alongside the characters. By following them in
                real-time as they race up and down stairs and peer into screens, the cinematography builds tension and
                urgency while maintaining the playfulness that defines the film. Its an example of how thoughtful,
                precise camera movement can make even a small, contained story feel expansive and alive.</p>

            <p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have films like <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</em>, which use
                cinematography to capture the thrill of motion on a much grander scale. In a film where cars tear
                through the streets of Tokyo at breakneck speed, the camera becomes as much a part of the action as the
                drivers themselves. Low angles emphasize the power and speed of the vehicles, while sweeping crane shots
                and rapid tracking shots pull us into the chaos and exhilaration of the races. Here, cinematography
                doesnt just show the action; it makes us <em>feel</em> it.</p>

            <p>However, camera angles can also be used to subvert these expectations. In <em>Godzilla Minus One</em>,
                low angles are used to suggest an internal conflict rather than simple dominance. Student Donald Craig
                explains:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>The upward camera angles portray Shikishima as an imposing figure, yet juxtaposed with his disheveled
                    hair, they hint at inner turmoil. This disarray intensifies after his disobedience... The weight of
                    his perceived failure is reflected in his downward gaze, a stark contrast to his initial confident
                    posture.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Jacob Ruffner breaks down how this geometry operates in one of the film's most iconic sequences:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>The scene uses a variety of different shapes, such as straight lines and circles with the camera, but
                    one of the most visually appealing is the arcs. For a couple of scenes, the cars swing from side to
                    side very quickly, making the chase seem more intense and high-speed. The apex of this geometry is
                    when Seans car is hit and has to do a massive drift through Shibuya Crossing—zoomed out initially
                    showing the car doing a massive arc through the crossing, then zooming in to show the car arcing in
                    slow motion.</p>
                <footer>&mdash; Jacob Ruffner, 2025</footer>
            </blockquote>



            <p>And then there’s a quieter approach, like that seen in <em>Adrift in Tokyo</em>. Satoshi Miki’s film
                focuses less on flashy camera tricks and more on composition, framing the bustling city streets of Tokyo
                as both a backdrop and a character in its own right. Static shots linger on moments of stillness or
                quiet humor as the characters wander aimlessly through their surroundings. By letting the visuals
                breathe, Miki uses cinematography to highlight not just the characters’ emotional journey but the
                unique
                rhythm and texture of the city itself.</p>

            <p>This use of <em>Ma</em> isn't limited to quiet films. Even the frantic time-loop of <em>Beyond the Two
                    Infinite Minutes</em> relies on these moments of stillness, lingering on an empty monitor to let the
                disorientation sink in.</p>
            <p>Now that we’ve laid the foundation for visual storytelling, let’s dive deeper into the
                tools of
                cinematography—exploring how light, framing, and movement are executed during production to shape
                the
                look and feel of a film. Whether it’s a simple stroll through Tokyo or a dizzying time loop, this
                is
                where the magic happens—one frame at a time.</p>



            <p><strong>Composition</strong>, the arrangement of people, objects, and settings within the frame of an
                image, has already come up a few times in previous chapters. Thats because how a cinematographer
                composes the image, how they <em>design </em>each shot, is one of the most important elements in
                cinematic storytelling. How those people, objects, and settings are arranged within the border of the
                image can bring balance or imbalance, reveal or hide information, indicate power or weakness, all
                without a word of dialog, an edit, or even a character on the screen.</p>


            <p>But before a cinematographer can start to think about how to properly compose a shot, they have one more
                decision to make: the shape of their frame. Okay, every frame (for now) is some variation on a
                rectangle. But the proportions of that rectangle will dictate how people, objects, and settings are
                arranged within it. This is known as the <strong>aspect ratio</strong>, the width of the frame relative
                to its height. The current standard for motion pictures is 16:9, or 1.78:1, a rectangle that is almost
                twice as wide as it is tall. But in the early days of cinema, the standard was much closer to a square,
                4:3, sometimes called the <strong>academy ratio</strong>. And sometimes filmmakers opt for a much wider
                frame, as wide as 2.35:1. That aspect ratio is a particular favorite of Quentin Tarantino. Whatever
                aspect ratio a filmmaker chooses will affect the choices they make regarding composition. Check out this
                quick comparison:</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center"><u><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/aspect-ratio.jpg"><img
                            alt="aspect ratio"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156767/aspect-ratio.jpg"
                            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></a></u></p>

            <p>Once a filmmaker has chosen their aspect ratio, the most basic starting point for composition, one we all
                intuitively understand from our own experience snapping photos with our phones, is balance. Images that
                are well-balanced use the space within the frame to evenly distribute visual interest, creating a
                proportional, pleasing composition. (Unless that’s not what you’re going for, but
                we’ll get to
                that).
                One way to achieve that balance is the <strong>rule of thirds</strong>. The idea is to divide the frame
                into thirds horizontally and vertically and line up areas of visual interest at the intersection of
                those points. Here’s an example:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;"><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/Ruleofthirds4-scaled.jpg"><img
                            alt="I" height="100%"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156768/Ruleofthirds4-scaled.jpg"
                            style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="100%" /> </a></div>
            </div>

            <p>By arranging the actors along the intersection of the grid lines, the composition feels well-balanced and
                proportional. It has the added benefit of helping to tell the story, where the two characters share the
                screen as equals.</p>
            <p>Now take a look at another image from the same film:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;"><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/Ruleofthirds3-scaled.jpg"><img
                            alt="i" height="100%"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156769/Ruleofthirds3-scaled.jpg"
                            style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="100%" /> </a></div>
            </div>

            <p>In this composition, the subjects are still evenly distributed within the frame, but the relative size
                difference between the characters indicates an unequal power dynamic. Again, helping to tell the story.
            </p>

            <p>We see this use of geometry to establish power dynamics in <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> as
                well. As student Grace Ochoa points out regarding the confrontation between Sean and DK:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>If we visualize an imaginary line splitting the screen, we can see that DK is to the left of the
                    screen and Han is on the right. Even as DK's goons, Sean, and Neela approach, we can clearly see the
                    division of both sides. The geometric composition creates a visual separation between the two
                    groups, furthering the tension already established.</p>
                <footer>&mdash; Grace Ochoa, 2025</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The rule of thirds is all about balance and proportion in the composition, to bring a sense of symmetry
                to the image. Some filmmakers take this notion of symmetry in composition to the extreme. Check out this
                supercut of Wes Anderson’s apparent obsession with symmetry in his films:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

                        src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/89302848"
                        style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;"
                        title="Vimeo video player"></iframe>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>This consistent use of balanced composition is one of the elements that makes a Wes Anderson film a Wes
                Anderson film. That pattern in his framing is part of his signature mise-en-scène.</p>
            <p>But just like three-point lighting, the rule of thirds is really just a starting point for understanding
                how composition can be used to help tell a cinematic story. Framing the shot is really about directing
                our attention, showing us where to look in the shot or scene, and ultimately, how to <em>feel</em> about
                it. There are lots of ways to do this.</p>
            <p>Take a look at how Nicholas Winding Refn uses another way to divide up the frame, a quadrant approach, to
                direct our attention in a given shot or sequence:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

                relationships and motivations using simple geometry:</p>

            <p>Try following those two actors through all of that with a camera on wheels!</p>
            <p>Pans, tilts, dollies, cranes, and steadicams, regardless of how a filmmaker moves the camera, one
                question they must always answer first is: Why move the camera at all? That is, is the movement
                <strong>motivated</strong>? In the case of Scorseses Steadicam shot above, were following the main
                characters into a nightclub. Motivation enough to move with them. Or that crane shot from <em>High Noon;
                    the</em> move reveals something important about the character. Again, solid motivation. But what
                happens when a camera move is <em>un</em>motivated? If the camera moves simply because the filmmaker
                thinks it "looks cool"? (I'm looking at you, <u><a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPtHPgZmZdA">Michael Bay</a></u>). Most often, an
                unmotivated camera move that isn't serving the story reminds the viewer they are watching a movie. The
                move becomes <em>visible</em> instead of <em>invisible</em>, and usually, thats the last thing a
                filmmaker wants. All of this is supposed to be invisible, remember?
            </p>


            <p>But sometimes, a filmmaker intentionally moves the camera without clear motivation to achieve a certain
                effect. For example, a tracking shot can move laterally through a scene with or without subjects in
                motion. Since there is no <em>reason</em> to move the camera, the movement can feel unmotivated and,
                therefore, more <em>noticeable </em>to the viewer. So why do it? Here’s a deep dive into how
                effective
                a
                lateral tracking shot can be:</p>

            <p>Maybe the best example of a really effective but completely unmotivated camera movement is one of
                filmmaker Spike Lee’s signature camera moves: The Spike Lee Dolly. At least once in every film,
                Spike
                Lee will put one or more characters on the same dolly as the camera and move them <em>both</em> through
                the scene. It’s disorienting and a little bizarre, but it creates a fascinating image that can
                draw
                the
                viewer into the psychology of the character:</p>

            <p>Well-planned and thoughtful camera movement, usually the motivated kind, can not only help tell the
                story, but it can also radically transform our relationship to the story. It doesn’t always have
                to be
                flashy. It could just be a subtle shift in perspective. A slight pan or a minute push in on a dolly. But
                it can change everything:</p>

            <p>The last point I’d like to make regarding cinematography is how really great cinematographers can
                combine
                <em>all </em>of the above into one continuous bravura shot that manages to move the story forward
                without a single edit. Don’t get me wrong, editing is important, and we’ll get to that
                next. But
                sometimes, a filmmaker finds a way to move through a scene, choreographing the actors and the camera
                department in such a way that the story unfolds in one long, continuous take. And it can be
                breathtaking.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, the shot above from <em>Goodfellas</em> is a pretty good example. Notice how Scorsese moves the
                camera through several different settings without ever needing to cut away from the shot. But the most
                famous <strong>long take</strong> is probably Orson Welles’s opening shot from <em>Touch of
                    Evil</em>
                (1958). Seriously, check this out:</p>

            <p>I'magine the planning required to choreograph that sequence. Everything had to work like clockwork (pun
                intended). And yet, nothing was sacrificed in terms of cinematic storytelling. Welles is able to move in
                and out of close-ups, medium shots and long shots, overhead crane shots and smooth tracking shots,
                directing our attention, revealing information and creating suspense. All without a single cut.</p>

                <em>Spectre</em> (2015):

            <p>Sometimes these long takes are much less noticeable. Take a look at how a filmmaker like Steven

            <h4>Acting for the Camera</h4>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges in film acting is working with the camera. Unlike theater, where actors
                perform continuously, film is shot in pieces, and often out of sequence. An actor might shoot the
                climactic scene of a film on the first day of production and a quiet, early scene in the last week. This
                means actors need to keep their emotional journey straight, even when the scenes arent filmed in order.
            </p>
            <p>The camera itself also changes the way actors perform. In films like <em>Late Spring</em> (1949), where
                YasujirÅ Ozu used low, static camera angles, the actors couldn't rely on movement to communicate
                emotion. Instead, their performances had to be more internal, expressed through subtle shifts in facial
                expression or body language. This is where the cameras close-up becomes an actors best friend. With
                the camera right up in their face, actors can convey volumes of emotion with the slightest change in
                expression"”a technique thats crucial to both naturalistic and Method styles.</p>

            <h4>Movie Stars and "Character" Actors</h4>

            <p>If you've learned anything about cinema in these chapters so far, hopefully it's that cinema requires
                dozens if
                not hundreds of professionals all working together to create the finished product. Production designers,
                sound
                technicians, editors, screenwriters, not to mention grips, gaffers, caterers, hair stylists, make-up
                artists, carpenters, truck drivers, the list goes on and on. But how many production designers can you
                name?
                Editors? What about screenwriters? Of all those talented individuals who work behind the camera, you
                might
                be able to name a few directors, but that's about it.</p>

            <p>Now, how about actors? How many of those can you name?</p>

            <p>Exactly. That's by design, of course. The entertainment industry has long understood the value of
                "stardom"
                and the power of celebrity to sell tickets. The early fan magazines were all controlled by the studios,
                creating and sustaining a culture of devotion to the movie stars that populated their films, and
                eventually,
                their television shows. Audiences flocked to movies like <em>Casablanca</em> (1942), <em>The Big Sleep
                </em>(1946), and <em>Key Largo</em> (1948) to see Humphrey Bogart, not Rick Blaine, Philip Marlow or
                Frank
                McCloud (his characters in each one).</p>

            <p>And that tradition has continued. How many of you rushed to see <em>Shutter Island</em> (2010) because of
                Teddy Daniels? Or <em>The Revenant</em> (2015) because of Hugh Glass? <em>Once Upon a Time"¦ in
                    Hollywood</em> (2019) because of Rick Dalton? Chances are you saw those films because Leonardo
                DiCaprio
                played each of those characters. Okay, it helped that they were directed by Martin Scorsese, Alejandro
                Iñárritu and Quentin Tarantino, but seeing Leo on the marquee didn't hurt. And no matter how hard he
                tries
                to lose himself in each role, we still see Leo up there on the screen. It's why we paid the price of
                admission. He is a <strong>movie star</strong> after all.</p>

            <p>This is the dilemma of the movie star in the entertainment ecosystem. The one thing that keeps them
                employed
                and well-paid as an actor, their celebrity, is the very thing that consistently undermines all of the
                hard
                work that goes into building a believable character. It also makes formal analysis of performance a
                somewhat
                fraught process. How does one disentangle the charisma and magnetism of a "star" from the character they
                are
                playing on screen? Sometimes that means evaluating a performance not on its own merits, but by just how
                much
                we forget who they are in real life.</p>

            <p>Of course, given all of the discussion above about technique, the last thing a professional actor wants
                is
                for anyone to remember they are, in fact, an actor while they are on screen. But there are plenty of
                professionals who avoid this problem by building careers that avoid the spotlight, playing secondary,
                often
                eccentric characters that we remember far more readily than we do the actors who play them. We often
                refer
                to them as <strong>character actors</strong>, which is a kind of backwards compliment. Shouldn't all
                actors
                be "character" actors? Still, unburdened by fame, character actors can truly lose themselves in a role,
                bringing authenticity to the narrative by supporting the "star" at its center. Even if all we can say
                about
                them is, "Oh yeah, he's that guy from that thing"¦"</p>

            </div>

            <p>This distinction between movie stars and character actors may seem somewhat arbitrary. Aren't "character
                actors" just actors who aren't famous (yet)? And aren't "movie stars" just actors trying to do their job
                despite their celebrity? I mean, it's not their fault they're famous. I think both are true, but it
                points
                to one of the unique challenges of acting for cinema. Unlike acting for the theater, cinema is part of a
                larger, capital intensive, highly technical medium. One performance can be seen by billions of people
                for a
                potentially limitless number of times. And that social/economic reality impacts both the way actors
                approach
                the work, and the way we approach their performances.</p>

            <p>But that's just one of the ways acting for cinema presents its own unique set of challenges for actors.
                The
                basic realities of production are an endless series of obstacles actors have to overcome to give a
                consistent, believably human performance.</p>

            <h4>The Challenges of Production</h4>

            <p>Let's start with the most basic obstacle that everyone on a film set must confront and somehow overcome:
                time. There usually isn't very much of it. Not only does it take a long time to set up, execute and
                dismantle every shot for every scene and sequence, the overall schedule is hemmed in by the competing
                schedules of other productions running long or needing to start on time tying up the cast and crew. The
                most
                immediate impact this time crunch has on actors is an extremely <strong>limited time for
                    rehearsals</strong>. In live theater, actors might have 4 to 6 weeks to rehearse their roles. In
                cinema,
                they're lucky if they get a day or two. Often that means "rehearsals" are really just the first few
                takes of
                every shot, working out how to deliver the lines, how to move in the space (known as
                <strong>blocking</strong>), how to play off the other actors.
            </p>

            <p>And if the lack of rehearsal time weren't bad enough, most films are <strong>shot out of
                    sequence</strong>.
                That is, the scenes shot each day do not follow the linear narrative of the script. There are lots of
                reasons for this. For one, scenes that must be shot at night must be grouped together so the cast and
                crew
                can get enough rest between each "day". And sometimes the production only has access to a particular
                location for a limited time, so all of the scenes set in that location must be grouped together as well.
                Or
                maybe a particular actor can only be on set for a limited time because of other obligations (see above
                regarding time), so all of the scenes with that actor must be grouped together. The net result is that
                from
                day to day (or night to night) actors must constantly re-orient themselves to where they are in the
                story.
                In theater, actors play the narrative through all at once, allowing their journey as a character to play
                out
                in real time. In cinema, actors bounce around the script playing bits and pieces of that journey, hoping
                the
                editor can find something consistent to cut together in the end.</p>

            <p>And if shooting out of sequence weren't bad enough, think about the near constant <strong>interruptions
                    between each shot</strong>. On stage, once the curtain goes up, the actors are on their own,
                carrying
                the story through to the end with no interruptions except maybe an intermission (or a noisy cell phone).
                In
                cinema, each shot is a complex, collaborative choreography of set design, lighting, sound recording and
                cinematography. To shoot one simple scene using the master shot and coverage technique requires at least
                three set-ups, often many more. And each set-up requires adjustments to lighting, set decoration, camera
                placement, all of which can sometimes take hours. Not to mention how often a take is interrupted or
                unusable
                because of an issue with the sound, or the cinematographer making small adjustments. Somehow, through
                all of
                that, the actors are supposed to deliver a consistent performance from shot to shot all while pretending
                they are not on a film set with a giant camera a few inches from their face.</p>

            <p>One of the best examples of just how difficult this process can be is in Tom DiCillo's indie masterpiece
                about indie filmmaking, <em>Living in Oblivion</em> (1995):</p>

            <p>So, you've got limited rehearsal time, shooting out of sequence and the interruptions between each setup
                and
                shot. All of which makes acting for cinema hard enough. But on top of all of that, with every new setup,
                the
                scene must be performed and shot over and over again until everyone is happy. A single 5-minute scene in
                a
                finished film may have taken hours if not days to complete with the actors repeating the scene dozens if
                not
                100s of times, over and over, bringing the same intensity and emotional vulnerability <em>every single
                    time</em>.</p>

            <p>Check out this scene from David Fincher's <em>The Social Network</em> (2010):</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

            </div>

            <p>It's a 5-minute scene. By my count, there are 5 setups, one master, two medium shots and two close ups.
                Fincher cheated a bit by using two cameras which cut down on the number of times they needed to move the
                camera, but they still took 2 days to shoot that scene in 99 takes. That means Jesse Eisenberg and
                Rooney
                Mara did the whole scene 99 times in row over two days to get it right. Exhausting!</p>

            <p>Oh, and those close ups where you only see one actor? Sometimes that actor is performing their side of
                the
                scene to an empty chair. Maybe their scene partner had another obligation. Maybe they had to reshoot
                that
                side of the scene weeks later and the other actor wasn't available. Or maybe they just got bored and
                left.
                We'll never know, but acting one side of a scene to no one, though relatively rare even in cinema, would
                never happen on stage.</p>

            <p>These issues have all been part of cinema and the challenges of production for actors from the very
                beginning. After all, cinema relies as much on technology as it does on art, so it should be no surprise
                (especially if you've read this far) that the process is incredibly complex with many moving parts. And
                each
                new innovation in the technology of cinema has required a certain amount of adaptation, both for the
                crew
                and for the cast.</p>

            <p>Take the introduction of sound in 1927, for example. Not only did production facilities and theaters have
                to
                adapt the new technology, including the birth of a whole new department on the crew, but actors had to
                add
                an entirely new dimension to their performance. Yes, they were used to speaking on the stage, that part
                wasn't necessarily new. But the introduction of recording equipment, often fastened to their costume and
                tethered to a sound recordist, was a new obstacle to overcome in the pursuit of an authentic, "natural"
                performance. Just when they were getting used to the camera in their face, they had to remember where
                the
                microphone was hiding:</p>

            <p>The <strong>influence of new technology</strong> on an actor's job has never really slowed down.
                Sometimes it
                has made the actor's job easier, such as smaller microphones and wireless technology, and sometimes it
                has
                made it a lot more complicated. The increase in Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) in the past few decades
                has
                meant actors are often on a soundstage surrounded by bright green walls acting a scene that will
                eventually
                take place in outer space or on another planet or even just a faraway location the production couldn't
                afford to travel to. To make matters even more complicated, new <strong>motion capture</strong>
                technology
                enables productions to not only transform the setting, but also the actors own body. Check out what
                Benedict
                Cumberbatch had to go through to play Smaug, a talking dragon in <em>The Hobbit</em> trilogy:</p>

            <p>Okay, so that's super creepy. But, Norma's no fool. The close-up is a powerful thing. And it's one of the
                most important not-so-secret weapons for an actor in cinema. You see, great actors understand that the
                most
                important relationship in a scene is not between them and the other actors, it's between them and the
                <em>camera</em>. The camera <em>is</em> the audience, that's who they're playing to. And unlike theater,
                where your intimacy with the actors is dictated by how much you were willing to pay "“ the rich folks
                get
                front row center and the rest of us end up in the balcony staring at the top of the actors' heads "“ in
                cinema our intimacy with the actors is dictated by how close the camera can get. Take another look at
                the
                clips I shared at the beginning of this chapter. Lilian Gish and her emotional breakdown in the closet
                as
                her father hacks his way in to kill her. Or even more devastating, Falconetti as Joan of Arc being cross
                examined by the priests. Shoot those scenes wide and you've still got compelling cinema. Cut to the
                close-up, and you've got something the transcends the medium. You've got a human connection.
            </p>

            <h4>I'm Ready for My Close-Up</h4>

            <p>It's one of the more famous final lines in cinema history. <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>, 1950, Norma
                Desmond,
                once a great silent actor, now a delusional recluse, is about to be arrested for murdering a
                screenwriter.
                She turns to the press, thinking they are the camera crew on the set of a new Cecile B. DeMille picture,
                and
                utters, "Alright, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

            <p>Let's look at one more example of the power of the close-up. It's from <em>Birth</em>, a 2004 thriller
                starring Nicole Kidman. The basic plot, as strange as it sounds, is that Kidman's character lost the
                love of
                her life, her husband, years earlier. Then one day, a young boy shows up at her apartment claiming to be
                the
                reincarnation of her dead husband. He knows much more than he should about their life together and it
                shakes
                her to the core. Soon after this revelation, she goes to the opera. The director, Jonathan Glazer, chose
                to
                shoot the scene as one long take, starting in a wide shot that moves into a close-up. There is no
                dialogue.
                Just two solid minutes on Kidman's face as she processes this impossible news:</p>

            <p>For those two minutes, you see a thousand different reactions play across her infinitely expressive face.
                Every twitch of her eye, every tear held back. It is a masterclass in subtlety and emotional
                vulnerability.
                Now, imagine seeing this on a stage from 100 feet away, much less in the balcony. It just doesn't work.
                This
                is where actors can shine on screen in a way they never could on stage.</p>

            <h4>A Collaborative Medium</h4>

            <p>We often think of the actor's role as singular, solitary. From Action! to Cut! the actor is the only one
                in
                complete control of their performance. But that performance is only one part of a much larger artistic
                and
                technical endeavor, one that requires collaboration between and among everyone involved. Take the
                actor's
                relationship with a director, for example. In a productive collaboration, an actor relies on their
                director
                to understand the shape of the completed narrative, how every piece will contribute to a unified
                aesthetic,
                as well as how the various technical requirements will be accomplished and add to the story. That
                enables
                them to focus on the scene in front of them, trusting that any input from the director is part of that
                larger design. When an actor doesn't trust their director, the results can be disastrous. But when they
                do,
                they can take risks and make choices in the moment that add up to something greater than any one
                individual
                performance.</p>

            <p>Take a look at how the great Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray can use something as simple as eye contact in
                <em>The Big City</em> (1963) to build up a narrative arc for his characters:
            </p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IszWRnZ5XGo" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;"></iframe>
                </div>

                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>From scene to scene, Ray no doubt directed his actors in the specific timing of their eye contact,
                knowing he
                wanted to use that as a thematic element. It might not have made perfect sense in the moment to an actor
                in
                a given scene, but they trusted their director to have a larger narrative purpose in mind.</p>

            <p>Sometimes a director's larger narrative purpose can extend beyond any single film. In the same way they
                may
                favor a certain framing or camera movement to express some unifying aesthetic of their work, they may
                direct
                their actors toward a particular way of interacting with each other or the environment. For example,
                Jane
                Campion tends to isolate and feature human touch throughout her films and tv series:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_L_X8AoUZI" frameborder="0"

            </div>

            <p>The relationship between the actor and director is, or should be, collaborative. That is, both have
                agency in
                the process.&nbsp; (Though there are some truly terrifying developments in technology that would remove
                that
                agency from the actor entirely.) But when the cameras stop rolling and the sets are dismantled, the
                actor's
                job is done. And it's the editor that must sift through those 99 takes of that one scene and make some
                sense
                of it. It's the editor that can shape and mold a performance over the running time of a film or tv
                episode,
                selecting the take that best dramatizes theme and narrative intent and works with what came before and
                what
                comes next.</p>

            <p>It's a fascinating process, and it can radically alter the raw performances in any given scene:</p>

            <p>Of course, this is all done in concert with the director, but that's the point. A motion picture is a
                collaboration, the result of a thousand moving parts built and maintained by a thousand different artist
                and
                technicians all applying the tools and techniques that have taken a century to evolve into the cinematic
                language we all share, as filmmakers and audiences. And will likely keep on evolving, changing and
                adapting
                for centuries to come.</p>
