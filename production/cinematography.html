        <h1>Cinematography (On Set)</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">

            <div class="art-banner-wrap">&nbsp;</div>
            <p>If <em>mise-en-scène</em> sets the blueprint for the visual language of a film, cinematography is
                where
                that vision comes to life. It’s not just about capturing what’s happening in front of the
                camera but
                about shaping how we see it. Through careful decisions about framing, movement, and lighting,
                cinematography transforms a static design into something dynamic and alive, guiding our emotions and our
                attention across the screen.</p>
            <p>Consider Junta Yamaguchi's <em>Beyond the Two Infinite Minutes</em>. A film that plays with the concept
                of time travel within a single confined space could easily feel visually repetitive, but Yamaguchi's
                cinematography keeps it fresh and engaging. Shot to look like one continuous take, the film's
                carefully
                choreographed camera work pulls us directly into the loop alongside the characters. By following them in
                real-time as they race up and down stairs and peer into screens, the cinematography builds tension and
                urgency while maintaining the playfulness that defines the film. It's an example of how thoughtful,
                precise camera movement can make even a small, contained story feel expansive and alive.</p>

            <p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have films like <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</em>, which use
                cinematography to capture the thrill of motion on a much grander scale. In a film where cars tear
                through the streets of Tokyo at breakneck speed, the camera becomes as much a part of the action as the
                drivers themselves. Low angles emphasize the power and speed of the vehicles, while sweeping crane shots
                and rapid tracking shots pull us into the chaos and exhilaration of the races. Here, cinematography
                doesn't just show the action; it makes us <em>feel</em> it.</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>The scene uses a variety of different shapes, such as straight lines and circles with the camera, but
                    one of the most visually appealing is the arcs. For a couple of scenes, the cars swing from side to
                    side very quickly, making the chase seem more intense and high-speed. The apex of this geometry is
                    when Sean's car is hit and has to do a massive drift through Shibuya Crossing—zoomed out initially
                    showing the car doing a massive arc through the crossing, then zooming in to show the car arcing in
                    slow motion.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Lighting also plays a huge role in the atmosphere of these night races. As student Wolf Dodson notes, the
                use of low-key lighting enhances the intensity:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>The race takes place at night and creates an effect of low-key lighting to provide a suspenseful
                    contrast between the reflective surfaces of the cars and the shadows on the landscape. The director
                    utilizes real-world elements such as headlights, street lights, and even natural moonlight. These
                    light sources also heavily influence and accentuate the slow-motion blurring effects used during the
                    race.</p>
                <footer>&mdash; Wolf Dodson, 2025</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>And then there’s a quieter approach, like that seen in <em>Adrift in Tokyo</em>. Satoshi Miki’s film
                focuses less on flashy camera tricks and more on composition, framing the bustling city streets of Tokyo
                as both a backdrop and a character in its own right. Static shots linger on moments of stillness or
                quiet humor as the characters wander aimlessly through their surroundings. By letting the visuals
                breathe, Miki uses cinematography to highlight not just the characters’ emotional journey but the
                unique
                rhythm and texture of the city itself.</p>

            <p>This use of <em>Ma</em> isn't limited to quiet films. As student Wolf Dodson notes, even the frantic
                time-loop of <em>Beyond the Two Infinite Minutes</em> relies on these moments of stillness:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>A good example of <em>ma</em> is how the camera lingers on the empty monitor after someone leaves.
                    This becomes even more noticeable—as well as disorienting—when a second monitor is introduced,
                    thereafter continuing the long loop of more and more empty monitors each time they bring a new
                    monitor in from the past.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Now that we’ve laid the foundation for visual storytelling, let’s dive deeper into the
                tools of
                cinematography—exploring how light, framing, and movement are executed during production to shape
                the
                look and feel of a film. Whether it’s a simple stroll through Tokyo or a dizzying time loop, this
                is
                where the magic happens—one frame at a time.</p>



            <p><strong>Composition</strong>, the arrangement of people, objects, and settings within the frame of an
                image, has already come up a few times in previous chapters. That's because how a cinematographer
                composes the image, how they <em>design </em>each shot, is one of the most important elements in
                cinematic storytelling. How those people, objects, and settings are arranged within the border of the
                image can bring balance or imbalance, reveal or hide information, indicate power or weakness, all
                without a word of dialog, an edit, or even a character on the screen.</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>The camera is in a constant dynamic state, tilting, panning, and hovering along with the racers. The
                    shots consisted of a mix of high, low, and perspective-level angles seemingly changing according to
                    tension—higher shots for close-call moments, lower shots for adrenaline and speed, and POV for the
                    reactions of the racers.</p>
                <footer>— Wolf Dodson, 2025</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>But before a cinematographer can start to think about how to properly compose a shot, they have one more
                decision to make: the shape of their frame. Okay, every frame (for now) is some variation on a
                rectangle. But the proportions of that rectangle will dictate how people, objects, and settings are
                arranged within it. This is known as the <strong>aspect ratio</strong>, the width of the frame relative
                to its height. The current standard for motion pictures is 16:9, or 1.78:1, a rectangle that is almost
                twice as wide as it is tall. But in the early days of cinema, the standard was much closer to a square,
                4:3, sometimes called the <strong>academy ratio</strong>. And sometimes filmmakers opt for a much wider
                frame, as wide as 2.35:1. That aspect ratio is a particular favorite of Quentin Tarantino. Whatever
                aspect ratio a filmmaker chooses will affect the choices they make regarding composition. Check out this
                quick comparison:</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center"><u><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/aspect-ratio.jpg"><img
                            alt="aspect ratio"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156767/aspect-ratio.jpg"
                            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /></a></u></p>

            <p>Once a filmmaker has chosen their aspect ratio, the most basic starting point for composition, one we all
                intuitively understand from our own experience snapping photos with our phones, is balance. Images that
                are well-balanced use the space within the frame to evenly distribute visual interest, creating a
                proportional, pleasing composition. (Unless that’s not what you’re going for, but
                we’ll get to
                that).
                One way to achieve that balance is the <strong>rule of thirds</strong>. The idea is to divide the frame
                into thirds horizontally and vertically and line up areas of visual interest at the intersection of
                those points. Here’s an example:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;"><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/Ruleofthirds4-scaled.jpg"><img
                            alt="I" height="100%"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156768/Ruleofthirds4-scaled.jpg"
                            style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="100%" /> </a></div>
            </div>

            <p>By arranging the actors along the intersection of the grid lines, the composition feels well-balanced and
                proportional. It has the added benefit of helping to tell the story, where the two characters share the
                screen as equals.</p>
            <p>Now take a look at another image from the same film:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;"><a
                        href="https://uark.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/17/2020/01/Ruleofthirds3-scaled.jpg"><img
                            alt="i" height="100%"
                            src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156769/Ruleofthirds3-scaled.jpg"
                            style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" width="100%" /> </a></div>
            </div>

            <p>In this composition, the subjects are still evenly distributed within the frame, but the relative size
                difference between the characters indicates an unequal power dynamic. Again, helping to tell the story.
            </p>

            <p>We see this use of geometry to establish power dynamics in <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> as
                well. As student Grace Ochoa points out regarding the confrontation between Sean and DK:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>If we visualize an imaginary line splitting the screen, we can see that DK is to the left of the
                    screen and Han is on the right. Even as DK's goons, Sean, and Neela approach, we can clearly see the
                    division of both sides. The geometric composition creates a visual separation between the two
                    groups, furthering the tension already established.</p>
                <footer>&mdash; Grace Ochoa, 2025</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The rule of thirds is all about balance and proportion in the composition, to bring a sense of symmetry
                to the image. Some filmmakers take this notion of symmetry in composition to the extreme. Check out this
                supercut of Wes Anderson’s apparent obsession with symmetry in his films:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

                        title="Vimeo video player"></iframe>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>This consistent use of balanced composition is one of the elements that makes a Wes Anderson film a Wes
                Anderson film. That pattern in his framing is part of his signature mise-en-scèƒ'©ne.</p>
            <p>But just like three-point lighting, the rule of thirds is really just a starting point for understanding
                how composition can be used to help tell a cinematic story. Framing the shot is really about directing
                our attention, showing us where to look in the shot or scene, and ultimately, how to <em>feel</em> about
                it. There are lots of ways to do this.</p>
            <p>Take a look at how Nicholas Winding Refn uses another way to divide up the frame, a quadrant approach, to
                direct our attention in a given shot or sequence:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

            <p>Try following those two actors through all of that with a camera on wheels!</p>
            <p>Pans, tilts, dollies, cranes, and steadicams, regardless of how a filmmaker moves the camera, one
                question they must always answer first is: Why move the camera at all? That is, is the movement
                <strong>motivated</strong>? In the case of Scorsese's Steadicam shot above, we're following the main
                characters into a nightclub. Motivation enough to move with them. Or that crane shot from <em>High Noon;
                    the</em> move reveals something important about the character. Again, solid motivation. But what
                happens when a camera move is <em>un</em>motivated? If the camera moves simply because the filmmaker
                thinks it "looks cool"? (I'm looking at you, <u><a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPtHPgZmZdA">Michael Bay</a></u>). Most often, an
                unmotivated camera move that isn't serving the story reminds the viewer they are watching a movie. The
                move becomes <em>visible</em> instead of <em>invisible</em>, and usually, that's the last thing a
                filmmaker wants. All of this is supposed to be invisible, remember?
            </p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>Throughout the entire scene the camera moves between each frame and character swiftly—almost
                    mimicking the way you might quickly turn your head at a basketball game or during a heated
                    conversation. The almost jerky, slightly shaky camera work sets the pacing for just how fast the
                    situation is escalating, while showing the urgency each character has.</p>
                <footer>— Grace Ochoa, 2025</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>But sometimes, a filmmaker intentionally moves the camera without clear motivation to achieve a certain
                effect. For example, a tracking shot can move laterally through a scene with or without subjects in
                motion. Since there is no <em>reason</em> to move the camera, the movement can feel unmotivated and,
                therefore, more <em>noticeable </em>to the viewer. So why do it? Here’s a deep dive into how
                effective
                a
                lateral tracking shot can be:</p>

            <p>Maybe the best example of a really effective but completely unmotivated camera movement is one of
                filmmaker Spike Lee’s signature camera moves: The Spike Lee Dolly. At least once in every film,
                Spike
                Lee will put one or more characters on the same dolly as the camera and move them <em>both</em> through
                the scene. It’s disorienting and a little bizarre, but it creates a fascinating image that can
                draw
                the
                viewer into the psychology of the character:</p>

            <p>Well-planned and thoughtful camera movement, usually the motivated kind, can not only help tell the
                story, but it can also radically transform our relationship to the story. It doesn’t always have
                to be
                flashy. It could just be a subtle shift in perspective. A slight pan or a minute push in on a dolly. But
                it can change everything:</p>

            <p>The last point I’d like to make regarding cinematography is how really great cinematographers can
                combine
                <em>all </em>of the above into one continuous bravura shot that manages to move the story forward
                without a single edit. Don’t get me wrong, editing is important, and we’ll get to that
                next. But
                sometimes, a filmmaker finds a way to move through a scene, choreographing the actors and the camera
                department in such a way that the story unfolds in one long, continuous take. And it can be
                breathtaking.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, the shot above from <em>Goodfellas</em> is a pretty good example. Notice how Scorsese moves the
                camera through several different settings without ever needing to cut away from the shot. But the most
                famous <strong>long take</strong> is probably Orson Welles’s opening shot from <em>Touch of
                    Evil</em>
                (1958). Seriously, check this out:</p>

            <p>Imagine the planning required to choreograph that sequence. Everything had to work like clockwork (pun
                intended). And yet, nothing was sacrificed in terms of cinematic storytelling. Welles is able to move in
                and out of close-ups, medium shots and long shots, overhead crane shots and smooth tracking shots,
                directing our attention, revealing information and creating suspense. All without a single cut.</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>The entire film is an example of a long take, as there are seemingly no cuts in action and the camera
                    follows the characters for the entirety of the film. The subtle movements of the camera make it feel
                    as if the viewer is a character following them around, as well as the long take which enhances this
                    feeling by making it seem as though the viewer is constantly moving.</p>

                <em>Spectre</em> (2015):

            <p>Sometimes these long takes are much less noticeable. Take a look at how a filmmaker like Steven
                Spielberg, not necessarily known for bravura camera moves, still finds ways to use the occasional long
                take to serve the story:</p>
