        <h1>Mise-en-Scène (On Set Adjustments)</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">


            <p>Now that we’ve explored the design phase of <em>mise-en-scène</em>—the careful planning of setting,
                character, and the aesthetic choices that form the foundation of a film—it’s time to see how all of
                those ideas are brought to life. If preproduction is the blueprint, production is where the magic
                happens. It’s where sets are built, costumes are worn, lights are placed, and cameras roll. It’s where
                directors, cinematographers, and actors take all of the planning and turn it into something real.</p>
            <p>Here’s the thing about production: no matter how much preparation goes into preproduction, once filming
                starts, nothing is as simple as it looks on screen. Actors might deliver their lines flawlessly in
                rehearsal but stumble under the glare of lights and the hum of a camera. That perfectly planned shot? It
                suddenly needs to adapt to the reality of the physical space or the unpredictability of natural light.
                Directors pivot, cinematographers tweak, and everyone on set collaborates to execute a vision that—if
                they’re lucky—matches what was in their heads.</p>
            <p>Take <em>13 Assassins</em> by Takashi Miike, for example. A battle scene meticulously planned in
                preproduction still had to adapt to real-world logistics. Dozens of actors, props, and intricate fight
                choreography had to work seamlessly within the frame. Every movement, every gust of wind, every beam of
                light became part of the production process, as Miike and his crew captured the chaos and beauty of a
                perfectly orchestrated cinematic moment.</p>
            <p>And let’s not forget: cinema is a visual medium, which is why two key elements of
                <em>mise-en-scène</em>—lighting and composition—come to life during production. This is the
                cinematographer’s playground, where decisions about framing, movement, and light transform a scene into
                something cinematic. Think of Makoto Shinkai’s <em>Your Name</em>, where the production’s lighting and
                composition work in tandem to elevate its emotional storytelling. The soft, golden glow of twilight
                (<em>kataware-doki</em>, as it’s referred to in the film) isn’t just beautiful; it’s pivotal to the
                story’s tone and themes, captured with precision during production.
            </p>
            <p>Production is also where actors breathe life into characters, whether through physical performances on
                set, like the grounded realism of Hirokazu Koreeda’s <em>Shoplifters</em>, or vocal performances in a
                recording booth, as seen in <em>Spirited Away</em>. In both cases, acting works in tandem with the
                visual elements of <em>mise-en-scène</em> to draw us deeper into the story.</p>
            <p>So, let’s pick up where we left off and look at how the elements of <em>mise-en-scène</em>—lighting,
                composition, and performance—move from the page to the screen. From the bustling streets of Tokyo in
                <em>Adrift in Tokyo</em> to the apocalyptic visions of <em>Akira</em>, this is where a film’s visual and
                emotional worlds finally come to life. After all, even the most brilliant plans are just plans until
                someone yells, <em>“Action!”</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Acting</h3>
            <p>Acting is the bridge between the script and the screen, turning written characters into living, breathing
                individuals that resonate with audiences. For students studying film, understanding the various
                approaches to acting—how actors prepare, how they perform, and how their work fits into the overall
                film—offers key insights into both the craft of acting and the process of filmmaking itself. Whether in
                classical, naturalistic, or emotionally immersive styles like Method Acting, the actor’s job is to make
                the character feel real.</p>

            <h4>From the Stage to the Screen</h4>
            <p>In the early days of cinema, acting borrowed heavily from the traditions of live theater. Actors, used to
                performing for audiences at a distance, relied on large, exaggerated gestures and expressions to convey
                emotions. This style of acting worked well on stage, but the intimacy of the camera demanded something
                different. The close-up changed everything. Suddenly, the smallest flicker of emotion—a raised eyebrow,
                a quick glance—could communicate as much as a dramatic monologue.</p>
            <p>In Japanese cinema, we see this shift in films like <em>Tokyo Chorus</em> (1931), where early
                performances still carry the weight of theater, with broad, expressive acting that connects to the
                stage. But as filmmakers like Yasujirō Ozu refined their style, actors began to lean into subtlety,
                creating a new form of acting for the screen that was quieter, more natural, and more attuned to the
                camera’s intimacy.</p>

            <h4>Classical Acting</h4>
            <p>Classical acting draws on centuries-old traditions, emphasizing precision in speech and movement. This
                style of acting often focuses on external expression—how an actor uses their body and voice to
                communicate the character’s intentions. It’s all about control and clarity, and less about deep
                emotional immersion. Classical acting works well for roles that require a sense of formality or
                distance, and in many historical or epic films, it’s the go-to approach.</p>
            <p>A perfect example is Akira Kurosawa’s <em>Ran</em> (1985), where Tatsuya Nakadai’s performance as Lord
                Hidetora reflects the influence of <em>Noh</em> theater. In this film, Nakadai’s measured, deliberate
                movements carry the weight of his character’s tragic downfall. His performance is rooted in tradition,
                using physical gestures and a calm, controlled demeanor to reflect inner turmoil. Here, the actor’s body
                becomes a tool for storytelling, much like in classical theater.</p>
            <p>But maybe you want a more up-to-date example of the classical approach. How about this:</p>

            <p>Morgan Freeman took on the role of Nelson Mandela for <em>Invictus</em> (2009) and approached it as a
                classically trained actor, trusting the script to convey what mattered most. In his own words, “The
                biggest challenge that I had was to sound like him. Everything else was kind of easy, to walk like him.
                I didn’t have any agenda as it were in playing the role. The agenda is incorporated into the script and
                all I had to do was learn my lines.”</p>

            <h4>Naturalistic Acting</h4>
            <p>While Method Acting draws from emotional intensity, <strong>Naturalistic Acting</strong> is more about
                subtlety and restraint. It’s not about big, dramatic gestures or deep dives into personal memories—it’s
                about making the character seem as real and relatable as possible. Naturalistic acting aims for
                authenticity in small, quiet moments.</p>
            <p>In <em>Tokyo Story</em> (1953), Setsuko Hara’s portrayal of Noriko is a masterclass in naturalistic
                acting. She doesn’t need to cry or shout to express her character’s emotions; a slight smile or a
                hesitant pause says it all. Hara’s performance is filled with these small, natural moments, where every
                gesture feels spontaneous, yet controlled. This type of acting thrives in films that focus on ordinary
                people and the small, everyday emotions that build up over time.</p>

            <h4>Method Acting</h4>
            <p>On the other side of the spectrum is the Stanislavski Method, or <strong>Method Acting</strong>, which is
                all about emotional truth. Originating from the teachings of Konstantin Stanislavski, Method Acting
                encourages actors to dig deep into their own experiences and emotions to bring characters to life. It
                began in Russia at the end of the 19th century, upending centuries of classical technique by encouraging
                his actors to let go of their grip on the text and trust their own emotional experience to guide their
                performance. The result was a more inward-looking, internal, often improvisational approach to acting,
                not to mention a more naturalistic style, and it became a slow-moving revolution in stage and screen
                performance throughout the 20th century. This approach became popular in Hollywood through actors like
                Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, but it also found its way into Japanese cinema, though not always in
                the same formalized way.</p>
            <p>Take Toshiro Mifune in <em>Seven Samurai</em> (1954). His portrayal of the wild and unpredictable
                Kikuchiyo is electric. Mifune didn’t simply play the role; he lived it, often improvising his lines and
                using raw, physical energy to convey the character’s complex mix of bravado and vulnerability. Though
                not formally trained in Method Acting, Mifune embodied the same core idea: using his own emotional well
                to fuel the character’s actions. His performance feels spontaneous, real, and unpredictable—like it’s
                happening for the first time in front of the camera.</p>

            <h3>Acting for the Camera</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges in film acting is working with the camera. Unlike theater, where actors
                perform continuously, film is shot in pieces, and often out of sequence. An actor might shoot the
                climactic scene of a film on the first day of production and a quiet, early scene in the last week. This
                means actors need to keep their emotional journey straight, even when the scenes aren’t filmed in order.
            </p>
            <p>The camera itself also changes the way actors perform. In films like <em>Late Spring</em> (1949), where
                Yasujirō Ozu used low, static camera angles, the actors couldn’t rely on movement to communicate
                emotion. Instead, their performances had to be more internal, expressed through subtle shifts in facial
                expression or body language. This is where the camera’s close-up becomes an actor’s best friend. With
                the camera right up in their face, actors can convey volumes of emotion with the slightest change in
                expression—a technique that’s crucial to both naturalistic and Method styles.</p>

            <h4>The Art of Voice Acting in Japanese Animation</h4>
            <p>Tokyo often serves as more than just a backdrop in Japanese cinema; it’s a character in itself. Actors in
                Tokyo-set films frequently portray characters grappling with the tension between tradition and
                modernity, a theme that often requires a blend of classical, naturalistic, and method approaches.</p>
            <p>In <em>Tokyo Story</em>, Chishū Ryū’s understated performance as a father dealing with the slow
                dissolution of his family is a quiet reflection of this tension. His acting isn’t dramatic or
                showy—there are no big emotional breakdowns—but through small, measured movements and quiet expressions,
                Ryū captures the heartbreak of watching his family drift apart. The same goes for Toshiro Mifune in
                <em>High and Low</em> (1963), where his intense, morally conflicted businessman carries the weight of
                both traditional honor and modern ambition.
            </p>
            <p>In Japanese <em>anime</em>, voice actors are known as seiyū, and their work is a highly respected craft.
                Much like how live-action actors develop techniques to refine their physical performances, seiyū undergo
                specialized training to develop vocal skills that allow them to portray a wide range of characters, from
                youthful protagonists to ancient spirits. Unlike traditional live-action acting, where gestures, facial
                expressions, and body language contribute to a performance, voice actors must convey all the emotional
                nuances, tension, and personality solely through their voice.</p>
            <p>As we’ve discussed how physical performances in live-action films draw us into the emotional and
                narrative core of cinema, it’s equally important to recognize the vital role of voice acting,
                particularly in Japanese animation, or <em>anime</em>. In animation, particularly in the works of
                directors like Hayao Miyazaki, voice acting is not just about delivering lines—it’s about capturing the
                very essence of the characters, their emotions, and their world. Just as Miyazaki carefully crafts his
                visual <em>mise-en-scène</em>—from the detailed settings to the interplay of light and shadow—the seiyū
                imbue each character with the emotional depth necessary to connect with the audience. Voice acting in
                anime becomes a performance of precision, where the actor must channel not only the character’s inner
                life but also synchronize perfectly with the visual rhythm of the animation.</p>
            <p>However, the importance of voice acting is not limited to <em>anime</em> alone.</p>
            <p>A recent example of the power of voice performances can be seen in <em>Inside Out 2</em>. Like Miyazaki’s
                work, <em>Inside Out</em> captures the emotional complexity of its characters purely through vocal
                expression. Amy Poehler, returning as Joy, brings energy and optimism, while new cast members like Maya
                Hawke, voicing Anxiety, add fresh layers to the emotional landscape of the film. Each voice actor
                skillfully embodies their respective emotion, creating characters that resonate deeply with audiences,
                even without the physical presence of live-action performers.</p>
            <p>Here’s a look at how the voice cast of <em>Inside Out 2</em> explores these emotions through vocal
                performance, blending humor, tension, and vulnerability in their characters:</p>

            </div>

            <p>This clip highlights the versatility and creativity that go into voice acting. Just as seiyū in Japanese
                animation capture a wide range of emotions—often working in isolation—the actors in <em>Inside Out
                    2</em> navigate complex emotional arcs using only their voices. Whether portraying Anxiety's nervous
                energy or Envy's high-pitched jealousy, these performances mirror the skillful voice work we see in
                <em>anime</em>, demonstrating how voice acting is an essential part of animated storytelling across
                cultures.
            </p>

            <h4>The Challenges and Rewards of Voice Acting</h4>
            <p>Voice acting presents its own set of challenges, much like physical acting in live-action films.
                <em>Seiyū</em> often work in isolation, recording their lines without interacting directly with other
                actors. This requires not only a strong imagination but also a deep understanding of the script, as they
                must anticipate how their performance will blend with others and the visual elements.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, voice acting can take a toll on the actor’s voice. In emotionally intense films like
                <em>Spirited Away</em> or action-packed <em>Castle in the Sky</em> (1986), actors may have to repeat
                highly charged lines dozens of times, pushing their vocal cords to the limit. It can be pretty intense:
            </p>

            <h4>The Emotional Power of Voice in Animation</h4>
            <p>Voice acting is, ultimately, another layer of <em>mise-en-scène</em>. Just as a director uses setting,
                lighting, and composition to craft the visual experience of a film, the voice actor uses their vocal
                performance to shape the emotional landscape of the story. In animated films, where the audience can’t
                rely on physical performances, the voice becomes the conduit through which emotion and character are
                conveyed.</p>
            <p>In Miyazaki’s films, voice acting works in harmony with his meticulously designed worlds, from the wind
                brushing through the trees in <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> (1988) to the eerie stillness of the bathhouse
                in <em>Spirited Away</em> (2001). The voices of his characters blend seamlessly with the visuals,
                creating a cinematic experience where every element—visual, aural, and emotional—is in perfect balance.
            </p>



            <p>Taken together, setting, character, lighting, and composition make up the key elements of design in
                creating an effective and coherent mise-en-scène. As discussed earlier, it’s one of the ways we can pick
                out the work of great filmmakers. A consistent mise-en-scène becomes a kind of signature style of a
                filmmaker.</p>
            <p>But it can also mark the signature style of a particular genre or type of cinema. Take <strong>film
                    noir</strong>, for example. Remember those detective movies I mentioned earlier? They are part of a
                whole trend in filmmaking that began in the 1940s with titles like <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> (John
                Huston, 1941), <em>Double Indemnity</em> (Billy Wilder, 1944), and <em>The Big Sleep</em> (Howard Hawks,
                1946). These films and many more are part of a style of filmmaking that includes a gritty, urban
                setting, tough, no-nonsense characters, low-key lighting, and off-balance compositions. Sometimes, they
                feature a private detective on a case, but not always. Usually, they were filmed in black and white, but
                not always. In fact, film noir – which literally means “dark film” in French (what is with all the
                French?!) – has been historically difficult to define because the specific elements can vary so widely.
                However, one easy way to identify a film as part of that tradition is through its mise-en-scène.
                Mise-en-scène isn’t about any one element; it’s that overall look, the whole, that is greater than the
                sum of its parts.</p>
            <p>And that can extend to a whole national trend in cinema as well. Because cinema is so profoundly
                connected to a particular cultural context, part of that gives and takes in the cultural production of
                meaning, it should come as no surprise that there are specific periods in a given place and time where
                cinema can take on a kind of national style. Where cinema artists in that same place and time are all
                speaking the same cinematic language, as a result, produces a unified, identifiable style, which is
                another way of saying a consistent mise-en-scène.</p>
            <p>One powerful example of a national cinematic style can be found in Japanese cinema.</p>
            <p>According to the Center for Japanese Studies, Japanese filmmaking is often characterized by long average
                shot lengths (ASL), slow or static camera movement, and the expression of emotions through natural
                elements. This minimalist visual style—seen in the works of directors like Yasujirō Ozu and Kenji
                Mizoguchi—often emphasizes deep focus shots, flat lighting, and scenes that linger on details that may
                not directly connect to the narrative but build the emotional and thematic depth of the story.</p>
            <p>Akira Kurosawa, one of Japan’s most celebrated filmmakers, used <em>mise-en-scène</em> masterfully to
                create epic, visually stunning films. In his film <em>Ran</em> (1985), Kurosawa uses vast landscapes,
                dramatic lighting, and careful composition to tell a deeply emotional story of power, betrayal, and
                madness. Watch this series of scenes from <em>Ran</em> to see how Kurosawa builds a cohesive visual
                style through his use of setting, character placement, and color:</p>

            <p>While live-action cinema showcases <em>mise-en-scène</em> in one way, animation offers an entirely
                different medium through which directors can control every aspect of the frame. In animation, everything
                is constructed: every element, from the background to the smallest character expression, is deliberately
                designed. This gives animators and directors incredible freedom to craft detailed, visually rich worlds
                where <em>mise-en-scène</em> plays a key role.</p>
            <p>Consider that Andre Bazin, a renowned and influential French film critic, asserted,</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>All art is founded upon human agency, but in photography alone can we celebrate its absence…
                    photography's objectivity confers upon it a degree of credibility absent from any painting.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Bazin believed cinema had the unique ability to capture reality, but animation poses an interesting
                counterpoint. It may not capture reality as live-action cinema does, but it creates an alternate
                reality—a world constructed from scratch, frame by frame.</p>
            <p>Take, for example, <em>Akira</em> (1988), an iconic Japanese animated film that pushed the boundaries of
                what animation could achieve. In <em>Akira</em>, lighting and movement play an essential role in
                building the dystopian world. The use of light not only adds texture but also creates mood, tension, and
                emotion in ways that live-action films struggle to replicate. Here’s a video analyzing how light is used
                in <em>Akira</em> to shape the atmosphere of its animated world:</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center">AKIRA: How To Animate Light</p>

            <p>In films like <em>Spirited Away</em> (2001), director Hayao Miyazaki demonstrates the power of hand-drawn
                animation in creating emotionally rich and visually immersive worlds. Spirited Away's attention to
                <em>mise-en-scène</em>—from the way spaces are designed to the emotional resonance created by lighting
                and composition—immerses viewers in the story in a way that feels almost tangible.
            </p>
            <p>Lev Manovich, a scholar of digital cinema, reflects on the role of manual image construction in
                filmmaking. He observes that in the digital age, CGI and other digital techniques have blended animation
                and live-action filmmaking, but traditional hand-drawn animation, as seen in <em>Spirited Away</em>,
                retains the rich, crafted feeling of older films. Miyazaki’s work is a testament to how animation can
                preserve the human touch, creating detailed worlds that feel as if they could be lived in.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Seen in <strong>this</strong> [rampant use of CGI in live action films] context, the manual
                    construction of images in digital cinema represents a return to nineteenth century pre-cinematic
                    practices, when images were hand-painted and hand-animated. At the turn of the twentieth century,
                    cinema was to delegate these manual techniques to animation and define itself as a recording medium.
                    As cinema enters the digital age, these techniques are again becoming commonplace in the filmmaking
                    process. Consequently, cinema can no longer be clearly distinguished from animation. It is no longer
                    an indexical media technology but, rather, a sub-genre of painting.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He follows up later by stating:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Manual construction and animation of images gave birth to cinema and slipped into the margins...only
                    to re-appear as the foundation of digital cinema. The history of the moving image thus makes a full
                    circle. Born from animation, cinema pushed animation to its boundary, only to become one particular
                    case of animation in the end.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Miyazaki's strategic use of close-ups intimately connects the audience with Chihiro’s emotional journey.
                Focusing closely on Chihiro’s expressions and reactions, these shots capture the subtle shifts in her
                emotions as she navigates the challenges of the spirit world. This careful visual articulation of
                Chihiro’s emotional state fosters a deep, empathetic connection, allowing the audience to feel her
                fears, joys, and growth. The emotional depth conveyed through these close-ups is pivotal, as it
                transforms Chihiro’s journey into a shared emotional experience with the audience, making her character
                development and the narrative’s emotional stakes more engaging and relatable.</p>
            <p>It may be true that CGI has essentially turned some live-action films into quasi-animations, but
                animation frequently employs techniques seen in live-action films. In fact, these techniques—like
                framing, composition, and lighting—are integral to how animated films, especially Miyazaki’s, achieve
                their cinematic impact.</p>
            <p>As we explore Miyazaki's work in the context of modern technology, creator and YouTuber DamiLee notes
                that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could never replicate the essence of Miyazaki's films, particularly
                those intimate, reflective "slice of life" moments that define his storytelling style:</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center">Why Studio Ghibli movies CAN'T be made with AI.</p>

            <p>As Dami points out, Miyazaki’s meticulous attention to <em>mise-en-scène</em> is evident in the way
                spaces within <em>Spirited Away</em> are designed to evoke the feeling of <em>ma</em>—the Japanese
                concept of negative space, emphasizing the tension and interplay between objects. <em>Ma</em> shapes how
                viewers perceive and interact with the film's world, allowing for moments of reflection and a deeper
                connection to the characters.</p>
            <p>The film's setting, infused with rich sensory details, invites viewers to feel the dampness on their skin
                or the wind in their hair, transcending cinema's visual and auditory mediums. This sensory engagement is
                achieved through detailed compositions that include lighting techniques like <em>komorebi</em>—the
                dappled light filtering through trees, which creates a dream-like atmosphere distinct to Studio Ghibli's
                storytelling style.</p>
            <p>This is the power of <em>mise-en-scène</em> in any context: to unify the cinematic experience and to
                provide the aesthetic foundation for everything else the filmmaker wants to express. Drawing on setting,
                character, lighting, and composition, <em>mise-en-scène</em> isn't just one technique; it’s the overall
                look, feel, and emotional tone of a film, and it’s far greater than the sum of its parts. This is why we
                began our exploration of cinema with <em>mise-en-scène</em>—because it allows us to see how everything
                else, from acting to story, works in harmony to create a film's unique world.</p>
