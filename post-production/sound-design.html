        <h1>Sound Design</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">

            <div class="banner-image-wrap"
                style="background-image: url('https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156816/ezgif.com-resize_3.gif');">
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </div>

            <p>Sound design is where the magic happens in post-production, taking raw audio and crafting it into an
                immersive soundscape that shapes the audience’s experience. Here, sounds aren’t just cleaned up—they’re
                created, layered, and manipulated to serve the story. Whether it’s enhancing dialogue, adding foley
                effects, or weaving a haunting score into the mix, sound design turns the invisible into the
                unforgettable, creating emotional and narrative depth that sticks with us long after the credits roll.
            </p>

            <p>In <em>Your Name</em>, sound grounds us in two vastly different worlds while also connecting them.</p>

            <p>The city hum of Tokyo contrasts with the natural symphony of Mitsuha’s rural town, from train crossings
                to cicadas, setting the stage for their body-swapping journey. But it’s in the surreal, otherworldly
                moments—when time bends and their worlds blur together—that sound plays its most crucial role.
                Atmospheric shifts and delicate tonal changes create an emotional resonance that guides the audience
                through their disorientation and longing. Here, sound doesn’t just accompany the visuals; it bridges
                gaps, turning moments of stillness into powerful reflections on memory and connection.</p>

            <p>Then there’s <em>Akira</em>.</p>

            <p>Neo-Tokyo hums with chaos, rebellion, and destruction, and its sound design doesn’t just mirror this—it
                embodies it. From the metallic screech of Kaneda’s iconic motorcycle to the bone-chilling, distorted
                reverberations of Tetsuo’s monstrous transformation, <em>Akira</em> uses sound to make the city itself
                feel alive, oppressive, and volatile. It’s dissonant and layered, forcing us to feel the tension of a
                society on the brink. These sounds weren’t captured on set—they were meticulously created in post,
                amplifying the intensity of every moment and drawing us deeper into this dystopian nightmare. Meanwhile,
                in <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, sound design plays with contrast to emphasize Kaneki’s fractured identity.
                Silence creeps in during moments of unease, only to be shattered by the wet, visceral sound of ghouls
                feeding or the distorted cries of their prey. Post-production sound here creates tension not just in
                what we hear but in what we don’t, as moments of quiet dread make every scream, step, and strike land
                harder. These auditory layers, from subtle breathing to monstrous growls, transform Kaneki’s internal
                conflict into an external sensory experience, making the soundscape as unsettling as the story itself.
            </p>

            <p>This is the power of sound design: it doesn’t just reflect what’s on screen—it deepens it, creating a
                world that feels richer and more alive. As we dig into ADR, foley, and sound editing techniques, keep
                these films in mind. They show us that sound isn’t just an accessory to the image; it’s co-expressive,
                shaping how we see, feel, and experience the world of cinema.</p>



            <p>In the last chapter, we focused on editing the visual elements in a motion picture and how the shots fit
                together to create a narrative flow and communicate with the audience. As it turns out, sound requires a
                similar approach in post-production and is often even <em>more </em>“invisible” than picture editing
                techniques. (In fact, if there are any sound editors reading this book, they probably noticed that
                picture editing has a whole chapter, and all they get is this one crumby section. Typical.)</p>

            <p>But sound editing is much more than simply joining up the sounds that already exist. It involves
                <em>creating</em> all of the sounds that weren’t recorded on set to make up the rich soundscape of the
                finished motion picture. In that sense, it is literally more “creative” than picture editing! (How’s
                that, sound editors? Feel better now?)
            </p>

            <p>One important bit of post-production sound creation has to do with dialogue. Sometimes, an actor’s
                dialogue for that perfect take is unusable because of distracting ambient sounds or a poorly placed
                microphone. (C’mon, location sound recordist, you had one job!) In that case, sound editors bring in the
                actors to perform <strong>ADR</strong>, short for Automated Dialogue Replacement (sometimes also
                referred to as Additional Dialogue Recording or “looping”). They simply play the scene in a repeating
                “loop” as the actors record the lines repeatedly until they match the performance on screen. Then, the
                sound editors adjust the quality of the recording to match the setting of the scene.</p>

            <p>But what about all those other sounds that weren’t recorded on set? The birds chirping, the cars passing,
                even those footsteps? Those too, have to be created and gathered together in post-production and layered
                into the sound design. Many of these sounds already exist in extensive sound libraries, pre-recorded by
                sound technicians and made available for editors. But many of them must be created to match exactly what
                the audience will see on screen. That’s where <strong>foley artists </strong>come in.</p>

            <p>Foley artists are a special breed of technicians, part sound recordists, and part performance artists.
                Their job is to fill in the missing sounds in a given scene. By any means necessary:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget120"

            </div>

            <p>Foley artists have to get creative when it comes to imitating common (and not-so-common) sounds. But
                sound editors must go beyond recreating the most obvious sounds associated with a scene. Every rustle of
                clothing, a hand on a cup, brushing a hair behind an ear. These tiny details, most of which we would
                never notice unless they weren’t there, help create continuity in the final edit.</p>

            <p>Yes, there’s that word again: <strong>continuity</strong>. Editing pictures for continuity means creating
                a narrative flow that keeps the audience engaged with the story. Editing sound for continuity has the
                same goal but relies on different techniques. For example, if we see someone walking on gravel but hear
                them walking on a hardwood floor, that break with continuity – or, in this case, logic – will take us
                out of the narrative. The soundscape must match the cinematography to maintain continuity. And since so
                much of the sound we hear in cinema is created and added in post-production, that requires incredible
                attention to detail.</p>

            <p>But there are other ways editors can use sound to support the principle of narrative continuity, and not
                always by matching exactly what we see on screen. For example, a <strong>sound bridge </strong>can be
                used to help transition from one shot to another by overlapping the sound of each shot. This can be done
                in anticipation of the next shot by bringing up the audio before we cut to it on screen, known as a
                <strong>J-cut</strong>, or by continuing the audio of the previous shot into the first few seconds of
                the next, known as an <strong>L-cut</strong>. This technique is most noticeable in transitions between
                radically different scenes, but editors use it constantly in more subtle ways, especially in
                dialogue-heavy scenes. Here are some quick examples:
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>And just like picture editing, sound editing can also work against audience expectations, leaning into
                <strong>discontinuity</strong> with the use of <strong>asynchronous </strong>sounds that seem related to
                what we’re seeing on screen but are otherwise out of sync. These are sound tricks intended to either
                directly contrast what we see on screen or to provide just enough disorientation to set us on edge.
                Here’s one famous example of asynchronous sound from Alfred Hitchcock’s <em>The 39 Steps</em> (1935):
            </p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget124"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilhh5bXwDv0"

                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>The woman opening the train compartment door discovers a dead body, but instead of hearing her scream, we
                hear the train whistle. In this case, we get an asynchronous sound combined with a J-cut.</p>

            <p>Production sound recording and sound editing are all part of the overall <strong>sound design </strong>of
                cinema, and there are lots of moving parts to track throughout the process. Take a look at how one
                filmmaker, David Fincher (along with Christopher Nolan, George Lucas, and a few others), uses all of
                these elements of sound design to embrace the idea of sound as co-expressive with the moving image:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">

            <div class="banner-image-wrap"
                style="background-image: url('https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156816/ezgif.com-resize_3.gif');">
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </div>

            <p>Once all of the sound editing is done and matched up with the image, the whole process moves to the
                <strong>sound mixer</strong> to finalize the project. And if you’ve ever wondered why there are two
                Academy Awards for sound, one for sound editing and one for sound mixing, this is why. (Or maybe you’ve
                never wondered that because that’s when you decided to grab a snack. I mean, who pays attention to Best
                Sound Mixing?) Sound mixers must take all of the various sound elements brought together by the editors,
                including the music composed for the score (more on that later), and balance them perfectly so the
                audience hears exactly what the filmmakers want them to hear from shot to shot and scene to scene.
            </p>

            <p>This is a very delicate process. On the one hand, the sound mix can be objectively calibrated according
                to a precise decibel level, or degree of loudness, for each layer of sound. Dialogue within a certain
                acceptable range of loudness, music in its range, sound effects in theirs. Basic math. On the other
                hand, the mix can and should be a subjective process, with actual humans in a room making adjustments
                based on the feel of each shot and scene. Most of the time, it’s both. When it’s done well, the audience
                will feel immersed in each scene, hearing every line of dialogue clearly, even when there are car
                crashes, explosions, and a driving musical score.</p>

            <p>For example, check out this deconstruction of the sound design from a single scene from <em>The Bourne
                    Identity </em>(2002):</p>

            <p>Sound mixing is one of those technical aspects of filmmaking that has evolved over the decades,
                especially as the technology for sound recording and reproduction has changed in more recent years.
                Starting with the birth of cinema sound in 1927, movie houses had to be rigged for sound reproduction.
                Which usually meant a couple of massive, low-quality speakers. But by 1940, sound mixers were already
                experimenting with the concept of <strong>surround sound</strong> and the ability to move the various
                channels of sound around a theater through multiple speakers to match the action on screen.</p>

            <p>As the century rolled on, newer, high-fidelity sound reproduction found its way into theaters, allowing
                for more sophisticated surround sound systems and, consequently, more work for sound mixers to create an
                immersive experience for audiences. George Lucas introduced THX in 1983, a theatrical standard for sound
                reproduction in theaters to coincide with the release of <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. In 1987, a French
                engineer pioneered 5.1 surround sound, which standardized splitting the audio into six distinct
                channels: two in the front, two in the rear, one in the center, and one just for low bass sound. As
                recently as 2012, Dolby introduced Dolby Atmos, a new surround sound technology that heightens the
                available options for sound mixers. Now, sound can appear to be coming from in front, behind, below, or
                above audiences, creating a 3-D aural experience.</p>

            <p>And every element in the final soundtrack has to be calibrated and assigned by the sound mixer. Check out
                how complex the process was for the sound mixers on <em>Ford v Ferrari </em>(2019):</p>

            <p>Finding the right mix of sound is critical for any cinematic experience, but one element that many
                filmmakers (and audiences) neglect is the use of <strong>silence</strong>. The absence of sound can be
                just as powerful, if not more powerful, than the many layers of sound in the final track. Silence can
                punctuate an emotional moment or put us in the headspace of a character in a way that visuals alone
                simply cannot.</p>

            <p>Check out how skillfully Martin Scorsese uses silence throughout his films:</p>

            <p>Of course, in most of these examples, silence refers to the lack of dialogue or a dampening of the
                ambient sound. Rarely is a filmmaker brave enough to remove all sound completely from a soundtrack. Dead
                air has a very different quality to it than simply lowering the volume of the mix. But a few brave souls
                have given it a try. Here’s French New Wave experimental filmmaker Jean Luc Godard playing an aural joke
                in <em>Band à part </em>(1964):</p>

            <p>It’s not actually a full minute of dead air – it’s more like 36 seconds – but it feels like an hour.</p>

            <p>Compare that to this scene from the more recent film <em>Gravity </em>(2013):</p>

            <p>That was also 36 seconds. Perhaps a little wink from the director Alfonso Cuaròn to the French master
                Godard. But both are startling examples of the rare attempt to remove all sound to great effect
                completely.</p>



            <p>One of the most recognizable elements in the sound of cinema is, of course, music. And its importance
                actually pre-dates the synchronization of sound in 1927. Musical accompaniment was almost always part of
                the theatrical experience in the silent era, and films were often shipped to theaters with a written
                score to be performed during the screening. Predictably, the first “talking picture” was a musical and
                had more singing than actual talking.</p>

            <p>As the use of sound in cinema has become increasingly sophisticated over the last century, music has
                remained central to how filmmakers communicate effectively (and sometimes not so effectively) with an
                audience. At its best, music can draw us into a cinematic experience, immersing us in a series of
                authentic, emotional moments. At its worst, it can ruin the experience altogether, telling us how to
                feel from scene to scene with an annoying persistence.</p>

            <p>But before we try to sort out the best from the worst, let’s clarify some technical details about how and
                what type of music is used in cinema. First, we need to distinguish between <strong>diegetic
                </strong>and <strong>non-diegetic </strong>music. If the characters on screen also hear the music we
                hear, that is, it is part of the world of the film or TV series, then it is <strong>diegetic
                </strong>music. If the music is <em>not</em> a part of the world of the film or TV series, and only the
                audience can hear it, then it is <strong>non-diegetic</strong> music. Too abstract? Okay, if a song is
                playing on a radio in a scene, and the characters are dancing to it, then it is diegetic. But if scary,
                high-pitched violins start playing as the Final Girl considers going down into the basement to see if
                the killer is down there (and we all <em>know</em> the killer is down there because those damn violins
                are playing even though she can’t hear them!), then it is non-diegetic.</p>

            <p>Diegetic versus non-diegetic sound is a critical concept in the analysis of cinema, and crafty filmmakers
                can play with our expectations once we know the difference (even if we didn’t know the terms before
                now). For example, non-diegetic music can communicate one emotion to the audience, while diegetic music
                communicates something entirely different for the characters on screen. Think about the movie <em>JAWS
                </em>(1975). Even if you haven’t seen it, you know those two deep notes – <em>da dum… da dum</em> – that
                start out slow, then build and build, letting us know the shark is about to attack. Meanwhile, the kids
                in the water are listening to pop music, completely oblivious to the fact that one of them is about to
                be eaten alive!</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget138"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rW23RsUTb2Y"
                        title="Jaws (1975) - Get out of the Water Scene (2/10) | Movieclips" width="100%"
                        frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>And this concept applies to more than just music. Titles, for example, are a non-diegetic element of
                mise-en-scene. The audience can see them, but the characters can’t.</p>

            <p>Second, we need to distinguish between a <strong>score </strong>written by a <strong>composer</strong>
                and what we could call a <strong>soundtrack </strong>of popular music used throughout that same motion
                picture. The use of popular music in film has a long history, and many of the early musicals in the
                1930s, 40s, and 50s were designed around popular songs of the day. These days, most films or TV series
                have a <strong>music supervisor </strong>who is responsible for identifying and acquiring the rights for
                any popular or pre-existing music the filmmakers want to use in the final edit. Sometimes, those songs
                are diegetic – that is, they are played on screen for the characters to hear and respond to – or they
                are non-diegetic – that is, they are just for the audience to put us in a certain mood or frame of mind.
                Either way, they are almost <em>always</em> added in post-production after complete filming. Even if
                they are meant to be diegetic, playing the actual song during filming would make editing between
                dialogue takes impossible. The actors have just to pretend they are listening to the song in the scene,
                which is fine since pretending is what they do for a living.</p>

            <p>But the type of music that gets the most attention in formal analysis is the score, the original
                composition written and recorded for a specific motion picture. A film score, unlike popular music, is
                <em>always</em> non-diegetic. It’s just for us in the audience. If the kids in the water could hear the
                theme from <em>JAWS,</em> they’d get out of the damn water, and we wouldn’t have a movie to watch. It is
                also <em>always</em> recorded after the final edit of the picture is complete. That’s because the score
                must be timed to the rhythm of the finished film, each note tied to a moment on screen to achieve the
                desired effect. Changes in the edit will require changes in the score to match.
            </p>

            <p>It is in the score that a film can take full advantage of music’s expressive, emotional range. But it’s
                also where filmmakers can go terribly wrong. Music in film should be co-expressive with the moving
                image, working in concert to tell the story (pun intended, see what I did there?). The most forgettable
                scores simply mirror the action on screen. Instead of adding another dimension, what we see is what we
                hear. Far worse is a score that does little more than tell us what to feel and when to feel it. The
                musical equivalent of a big APPLAUSE sign.</p>

            <p>These tendencies in cinematic music are what led philosopher and music critic Theodor Adorno to complain
                that the standard approach to film scores was simply to “interpret the meaning of the action of the less
                intelligent members of the audience.” Ouch. But, in a way, he’s not wrong. It's not about the less
                intelligent bit. But about how filmmakers <em>assume</em> a lack of intelligence, or maybe awareness, of
                the power of music in cinema. Take the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example. You all know the theme of
                <em>JAWS</em>. You probably also know the musical theme for <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Raiders of the Lost
                    Ark</em>, and maybe even <em>Harry Potter</em>. But can you hum a single tune from <em>any</em>
                Marvel movie? Weird, right? Check this out:
            </p>

            <p>The best cinema scores can do so much more than simply mirror the action or tell us how to feel. They can
                set a tone, play with tempo, and subvert expectations. Music designed for cinema with the same care and
                thematic awareness as cinematography, mise-en-scene, or editing can transform our experience without us
                even realizing how and why it is happening.</p>

            <p>Take composer Hans Zimmer, for example. Zimmer has composed scores for over 150 films, working with
                dozens of filmmakers. And he understands how music can support and enhance a narrative theme, creating a
                cohesive whole. In his work with Christopher Nolan, <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008), <em>Inception
                </em>(2010), and <em>Interstellar</em> (2014), his compositions explore the recurring theme of time:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">

            </div>

            <p>Musical scores can also emphasize a moment or signal an important character. Composers use recurring
                themes, or <strong>motifs</strong>, as a kind of signature (or even a brand) for a film or tv series.
                The most famous of these are the ones you can probably hum to yourself right now, again like <em>Star
                    Wars</em>, <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, maybe even <em>Harry Potter</em>. Composers can use
                this same concept for a specific character as well, known as a <strong>leitmotif</strong>. Think of
                those two ominous notes we associate with the shark in <em>JAWS</em>. That’s a leitmotif. Or the
                triumphant horns we hear every time Indiana Jones shows up in <em>Raiders</em>. That’s a leitmotif.</p>

            <p>Oh, and all those movies I mentioned just now? They all have the same composer. His name is John
                Williams. And he’s a legend:</p>

            <p>While we are not analyzing a Studio Ghibli film in this section, I would be remiss not to mention Mamoru
                Fujisawa, better known by his professional name, Joe Hisaishi, a Japanese composer and conductor whose
                partnership with Miyazaki began in the early 1980s. In fact, Hisaishi's success and global recognition
                garnered him the moniker ‘the Japanese John Williams.’</p>

            <p>Yet, as amazing has Hisaishi and Williams are as composers, cinema is set apart as an art form for its
                ability, and need, to blend all of the arts into something more, and it is the blend of Miyazaki's
                artistry and vision, Hisaishi's emotive compositions, and uniquely Japanese sentiment that creates
                Ghibli's magic.</p>

            <p>For instance, Shantanu Singh over at <u><a
                        href="https://medium.com/@shantanusighs/studio-ghibli-the-mechanics-behind-miyazakis-melody-of-nostalgia-f77a254b712d">Medium</a></u>
                notes:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>One of the things that Miyazaki often talks about is “Ma”, or as he calls it, the silence between the
                    clap. “Ma” is a Japanese concept that refers to the respite between activity. Miyazaki deftly
                    integrates this respite within his work. He makes sure that there is stillness between the chaos. A
                    moment where you can pause and just enjoy the beautiful scenery, the vibrant colors, and the music
                    that accompanies it all.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>We do have the option, however, of studying another notable collaborative duo, Shinichiro Watanabe and
                Yoko Kanno, who created Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy, and others, who are directly
                inspired by not only a genre of music but are crafted like a (delightfully) self-contained album.</p>

            <p>GammaRay gives us a nice documentation of Shinichiro's inspirations as well as how Kanno inspired
                Watanabe in real-time:</p>
