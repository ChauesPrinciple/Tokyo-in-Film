            <h3>What is animation?</h3>

            <p>Animation is the illusion of movement created by a series of sequential images that are displayed at a
                rapid rate. We are familiar with animation in film or television, yet we know that animation can be
                created in other devices, such as flipbooks and optical toys like the zoetrope. In film animation,
                <strong>frame rate</strong> refers to how many frames are projected per second. Frame rate is key to
                animation; if the frame rate is too slow, the illusion of movement is destroyed.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Stop Motion Animation</strong></h4>

            <p>Several standard techniques have been used to create animation since the origin of cinema. In 2D
                animation, sequential drawings are created and photographed to be played back at a specific frame rate.
                <strong>Stop motion</strong> has also been used since the early days of cinema. Objects are moved or
                adjusted a small amount, and each adjustment is photographed. More recent methods include
                <strong>computer-generated imagery (CGI), </strong>using hardware and software to create animation using
                computers for 3D animation and visual effects. In this class, we will examine animation's origins and
                study how animation production models and styles have evolved worldwide using these techniques.

            <h4><strong>Computer Animation (CGI)</strong></h4>

            <p>What creates this illusion of motion that we see demonstrated in animation? English-Swiss physicist Peter
                Mark Roget first named a theory of perception called persistence of vision. He described it as a
                phenomenon in which an object that was moving at a particular speed would appear to be static. The term
                later became identified with a theory put forward by Joseph Plateau, the inventor of the optical toy the
                phenakistiscope, that successive images stayed on the retina of the eye, combining them, creating the
                illusion of motion. This theory was accepted into the 20th century when psychologist Max Wertheimer
                conducted experiments that led him to believe that the brain was involved in processing the information
                in this phenomenon, not merely the retina. In 1915, Hugo Munsterberg postulated that the apparent motion
                we perceive involves the brain. Subsequent research has shown that the properties of vision, such as
                color, motion, and depth, are transmitted to the brain from the retina and are joined together in the
                visual cortex.</p>

            <figure class="mt-align-center" id="attachment_568"><img alt="3D Animation"

                evolved.</p>

            <h3>Persistence of Vision</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Persistence of vision</strong> is the optical phenomenon where the illusion of motion is
                    created because the brain interprets multiple still images as one. When multiple images appear in
                    fast enough succession, the brain blends them into a single, persistent, moving image.</p>

                <p>The human eye and brain can only process about 12 separate images per second, retaining an image for
                    1/16 of a second. If a subsequent image is replaced during this time frame, an illusion of
                    continuity is created.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>(from Maia, Alyssa, “What is Persistence of Vision? Definition of an Optical Phenomenon”
                    StudioBinder.com May 11, 2020 <u><a
                            href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-persistence-of-vision-definition/">https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-persistence-of-vision-definition/)</a></u></em>
            </p>

            <h3>Frame Rate</h3>

            <p>It’s important to remember that frame rate is based on the properties of human vision, which is how our
                brain processes the information that our eye perceives. At a frame rate of one drawing per second, you
                perceive each drawing as a completely separate entity. As you increase the frame rate, you begin to see
                a choppy illusion of movement. At around 10-12 frames per second, the illusion is consistent, though if
                becomes much smoother if you keep increasing the rate. Film animation is traditionally 24 frames per
                second.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><strong><b>Frame rate</b></strong> (expressed in <strong><b>frames per second</b></strong> or
                    <strong><b>FPS</b></strong>) is the frequency (rate) at which consecutive images called frames
                    appear on a display. The term applies equally to film and video cameras, computer graphics, and
                    motion capture systems. The frame rate may also be called the frame frequency and can be expressed
                    in hertz.
                </p>

                <p>The temporal sensitivity and resolution of human vision varies depending on the type and
                    characteristics of visual stimulus, and it differs between individuals. The human visual system can
                    process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived
                    as motion.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Japanese Animation</h3>

            <p>Hayao Miyazaki's contribution to animation is unparalleled. His films blend intricate detail, profound
                narratives, and a distinctive approach to sound and visuals. His works, including <i>Princess
                    Mononoke</i>, showcase an adeptness at exploring complex themes through meticulously crafted worlds.
                His animation style is characterized by meticulous detail, vibrant landscapes, and a fluidity of
                movement that breathes life into every frame. Through his work, Miyazaki invites viewers into worlds
                imbued with wonder, challenge, and a deep respect for the environment, underpinned by a distinctive
                narrative depth that appeals to children and adults alike.</p>

            <p>Miyazaki's films are not just visual spectacles but symphonies of sound and sight. Each film establishes
                its unique sound identity from the opening frame, crafting a signature aural personality that enhances
                the storytelling. This attention to sound design is crucial, as it fills the spaces his characters
                inhabit, defining those spaces with layers of meaning and emotion. <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> exemplifies
                Miyazaki's serene and whimsical approach, where the natural sounds of lush forests take precedence,
                inviting the audience into a tranquil world brimming with the magic of nature. In contrast, <i>Princess
                    Mononoke</i> presents a starkly different soundscape that uses nature as a backdrop to explore
                themes of conflict, industrialization, and the struggle between the human and the natural world. It is a
                film where every sound is charged with intention, from the screeching arrows to the swift sword swipes,
                creating a dynamic atmosphere that propels the narrative forward.</p>

            <p><i>Princess Mononoke</i> is a seminal work in Miyazaki's career. It is a compelling tale that delves into
                the complexity of environmentalism, war, and humanity's place within the natural world. However, a
                lesser-known film, <i>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</i>, stands at the inception of Miyazaki's
                thematic and stylistic explorations.</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center"><img alt="Nausicaa title image" height="396px"
                    src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156776/nausicaa.jpg"
                    style="width: 280px; height: auto;" width="280px" /></p>

            <p>Released initially in the U.S. as "Warriors of the Wind," <i>Nausicaä</i> suffered from <strong><b>severe
                        editing</b></strong> that distorted its narrative and themes, leading to confusion and a poor
                reception outside Japan. This unapproved editing, which saw subplots and characters removed and an
                entirely new dialogue crafted, was a turning point for Miyazaki. It underscored his resolve for future
                productions to remain uncut by U.S. distributors, ensuring the integrity of his work. The uncut version,
                released in 2005 with a new dub featuring prominent actors, finally allowed U.S. audiences to experience
                the film as Miyazaki intended, and this anecdote is a microcosm that explains why editing is so
                essential in the animation process.</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center"><img alt="Nausicaa image 2" height="270px"

                    style="width: 500px; height: auto;" width="500px" /></p>

                    style="width: 500px; height: auto;" width="500px" /></p>

            <p><i>Nausicaä</i> embodies Miyazaki's philosophy on the unique potential of animation. He asserts that
                unlike live-action films, which are constrained by the realism of their special effects, animation
                "<strong>illustrate</strong><strong>[s] a world of lost possibilities.</strong>" Animation offers a
                boundless canvas. Considered the foundation of Studio Ghibli, despite its release before the studio's
                formation, <i>Nausicaä</i> encapsulates the narrative and stylistic ambitions Miyazaki and his
                co-founders sought to realize; the film is a testament to animation's power to address weighty themes
                such as environmentalism and humanity's role within nature, without preaching. Its portrayal of
                three-dimensional characters, notably strong female protagonists and nuanced antagonists, along with a
                deep reverence for nature, sets a template for Miyazaki's later works.</p>

            <p class="mt-align-center"><img alt="Image from Nausicaa depicting flyer" height="270px"
                    src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156779/nausicaa009.jpg"
                    style="width: 500px; height: auto;" width="500px" /></p>

            <p><em>Nausicaä</em> laid the groundwork for the thematic and stylistic flourishes defining Miyazaki's work,
                marking a significant moment in his career and the broader animation landscape. It underscored the power
                of animation to convey complex, mature themes in a manner that transcends age and cultural barriers,
                setting a high bar for animated storytelling. <i>Princess Mononoke</i> later revisits and expands upon
                these themes and is the first animated film to win an Oscar.</p>

            <p>Released in the wake of Miyazaki's early works, <em>Akira, </em>another iconic animated film we are
                studying, propelled the medium into new territories of narrative and technical excellence. While
                Miyazaki's films like <em>Nausicaä</em> and <em>Princess Mononoke</em> deeply explored the harmony and
                discord between humanity and nature, <em>Akira</em> took a grittier approach to examining society,
                technology, and human potential. Set against the backdrop of a dystopian future, <em>Akira </em>delves
                into themes of power, identity, and the consequences of unchecked technological advancement,
                distinguishing itself with a bold narrative and stylistic audacity that challenges and expands the
                global perception of what anime could be.</p>

            <p><em>Akira </em>emerged as a groundbreaking masterpiece when anime was scarcely known outside Japan,
                setting the stage for the genre's mainstream acceptance in the West. Its success demonstrated anime's
                universal appeal, breaking cultural barriers with its unique style, complex storytelling, and mature
                themes. The film distinguished itself from Western animations through its artistic and narrative
                innovation, offering a thought-provoking narrative on dystopian futures and human complexities. This
                contrast challenged prevailing norms and redefined animation's potential audience and scope.</p>

            <p>The film capitalized on Japan's economic boom in the 1980s, leveraging an unprecedented budget to achieve
                technical excellence in animation. The "Akira Committee" pooled resources to meet Ôtomo's ambitious
                vision, utilizing 24 frames per second for fluid motion and incorporating CGI for artistic effects. Such
                technical advancements, including using 70mm film and prescoring to match voice performances with
                animation, set new standards in the industry. Akira's commitment to quality was evident in its detailed

            <h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Special Effects in Film Production</h3>

            <p>Special effects (SFX) are an essential part of modern filmmaking, enabling directors to create worlds,
                enhance scenes, and immerse audiences in ways that would otherwise be impossible. From practical on-set
                effects to advanced computer-generated imagery (CGI), special effects provide filmmakers with powerful
                tools to tell their stories more effectively. Below, we explore how these tools are used and applied in
                today’s productions, keeping in mind cost, control, and creative goals.</p>

            <h3>Studio and Location Integration</h3>

            <p>Advancements in special effects technology have allowed filmmakers to blend studio shots seamlessly with
                location footage. For instance, a foreground shot filmed on a studio set can now be composited with a
                digitally created or filmed background, creating the illusion of being on location without ever leaving
                the controlled environment of the studio. This approach offers several advantages:</p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: By reducing the need to transport, house, and feed a crew on
                    location, productions can allocate resources more effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Over Variables</strong>: Shooting in a studio eliminates concerns about weather,
                    lighting conditions, and unexpected interruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sound Quality</strong>: Controlled environments allow for cleaner, more consistent audio
                    recording.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Pinewood Studios in Georgia has become a hub for major film productions thanks
                to its facilities and the tax incentives offered by the state. Many filmmakers now use such studios to
                shoot key scenes while relying on effects to simulate expansive locations. Similarly, films like <em>13
                    Assassins</em> by Takashi Miike use controlled environments to enhance complex battle scenes,
                blending traditional set design with digital enhancements to elevate realism.</p>

            <h3>Practical vs. Digital Effects</h3>

            <h4>Practical Effects</h4>

            <p>Practical effects are those created physically on set. These include explosions, rain machines,
                animatronics, and prosthetics. Despite the rise of CGI, practical effects remain popular for their
                realism and tangible quality.</p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>

                    <ul data-spread="false">
                        <li>Create authentic reactions from actors.</li>
                        <li>Often cost less for smaller-scale effects compared to CGI.</li>
                        <li>Add a sense of physicality that can be challenging to replicate digitally.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tips for Use:</strong></p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li>Plan practical effects during pre-production to ensure safety and precision.</li>
                <li>Combine them with CGI for the best of both worlds, such as adding digital embellishments to
                    practical explosions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In <em>The Seven Samurai</em> by Akira Kurosawa, practical effects like staged
                rain and intricate set designs ground the film’s epic battle scenes in visceral realism. This technique
                continues to inspire contemporary directors, including Takashi Kitano in <em>Kubi</em>.</p>

            <h4>Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI)</h4>

            <p>CGI is a cornerstone of modern filmmaking, allowing filmmakers to create anything from fantastical
                creatures to entire worlds. However, it’s important to use CGI strategically to avoid breaking audience
                immersion.</p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li><strong>Examples of Use:</strong>

                    <ul data-spread="false">
                        <li>Set extensions: Adding massive cityscapes or distant mountains to studio sets, as seen in
                            <em>Your Name</em> and <em>Suzume</em> by Makoto Shinkai.
                        </li>
                        <li>Digital doubles: Creating stunt doubles or crowds for large-scale scenes, such as in
                            <em>Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Environmental effects: Simulating weather, fire, or water, like the post-apocalyptic Tokyo
                            of <em>Akira</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tips for Use:</strong></p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li>Ensure proper lighting is on set to match the CGI elements added later.</li>
                <li>Work closely with VFX artists during filming to ensure the actors’ performances align with the
                    planned digital effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Techniques and Tools</h3>

            <h4><strong>Chroma Keying</strong></h4>

            <p>One of the most common techniques in visual effects is chroma keying (green/blue screen). This involves
                filming actors in front of a colored background that is replaced with another image or footage in
                post-production.</p>

            <p><strong>Application:</strong></p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li>Use green screens to shoot flying sequences or alien landscapes, as seen in <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em> by
                    Shûhei Morita.</li>
                <li>Ensure actors avoid wearing colors that match the background to prevent blending issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><strong>Miniatures and Models</strong></h4>

            <p>Even in the digital age, miniatures are often used to create detailed, large-scale environments that look
                more realistic than digital renders.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The detailed dystopian cityscape in <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> by Takashi
                Yamazaki demonstrates how miniatures and CGI can combine to create striking visuals.</p>

            <h3>Evaluating Special Effects</h3>

            <p>When analyzing or planning special effects, keep the following in mind:</p>

            <ol data-spread="false" start="1">
                <li><strong>Believability</strong>: Do the effects integrate seamlessly with the live-action elements?
                </li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Impact</strong>: Do they serve the narrative and enhance the emotional resonance
                    of the scene?</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Execution</strong>: Are the effects technically sound, avoiding distracting flaws?
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Balancing Creativity and Practicality</h3>

            <p>Special effects are not just about spectacle; they are storytelling tools. They should support the
                narrative, drawing the audience deeper into the world of the film without overshadowing the story
                itself. Whether using practical effects, digital effects, or a combination, planning, and collaboration
                between directors, effects teams, and actors are key to achieving memorable results.</p>

            <h3>Animation: The Connection to Special Effects</h3>

            <p>Animation and special effects share a fundamental goal: creating the illusion of motion or reality that
                engages the audience. The two often overlap in their techniques and applications, particularly in
                computer-generated imagery (CGI).</p>

            <h4><strong>Computer Animation and Special Effects</strong></h4>

            <p>CGI blurs the line between animation and live-action. It enables filmmakers to:</p>

            <ul data-spread="false">
                <li>The CGI in <em>Your Name</em> enhances the film by crafting detailed, photorealistic environments
                    that support the story’s emotional depth and themes. For instance, the urban landscapes of Tokyo are
                    rendered with intricate details such as neon reflections and bustling streets, creating a vivid
                    sense of modernity and connection. In contrast, the serene rural vistas of Itomori showcase vibrant
                    natural elements like flowing rivers and expansive skies, emphasizing themes of tradition and
                    distance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><strong>Frame Rate and Illusion of Motion</strong></h4>

            <p>Just as the frame rate is critical to animation, it is also essential in special effects. A consistent
                frame rate ensures that CGI elements synchronize with live-action footage, maintaining the illusion of
                realism. Whether animating a character or crafting a digital storm, understanding frame rate is vital to
                effective special effects design. <em>Jujutsu Kaisen: Shibuya Incident</em> showcases precise frame-rate
                adjustments in animated fight sequences, enhancing their impact and fluidity.</p>
