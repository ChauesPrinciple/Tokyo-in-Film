            <p>They say a film is made three times. The first is by the screenwriter. The second was by the director and
                crew. The third is done by the <strong>editor</strong> in <strong>post-production</strong>.</p>

            <p>I don’t know who “they” are, but I think they’re onto something.</p>

            <p>When the screenwriter hands the script off to the director, it is no longer a literary document; it’s a
                blueprint for a much larger, more complex creation. A production process is essentially an act of
                translation, taking all of those words on the page and turning them into shots, scenes, and sequences.
                At the end of that process, the director hands off a mountain of film and/or data, hours of images, to
                the editor for them to sift through, select, arrange, and assemble into a coherent story. That, too, is
                essentially an act of translation.</p>

            <p>The amount of film or data can vary. During the Golden Age of Hollywood last century, most feature films
                shot about 10 times more film than they needed, otherwise known as a <strong>shooting ratio</strong> of
                10:1. That includes all of the re-takes, spoiled shots, multiple angles on the same scene, subtle
                variations in performance for each shot, and even whole scenes that will never end up in the finished
                film. And the editors had to look at all of it, sorting through 10 hours of footage for every hour of
                film in the final cut.</p>

            <p>They didn’t know it then, but they were lucky.</p>

            <p>With the rise of digital cinema, that ratio has <em>exploded</em>. Today, it is relatively common for a
                film to have 50 or 100 times more footage than will appear in the final cut. The filmmakers behind
                <em>Deadpool</em> (2016), for example, shot 555 hours of raw footage for a final film of just 108
                minutes. That’s a shooting ratio of 308:1. It would take 40 hours a week for 14 weeks just to watch all
                of the raw footage, much less select and arrange it all into an edited film!
            </p>

            <p>So, one of the primary roles of the editor is to simply manage this tidal wave of moving images in
                post-production. But they do much more than that. And their work is rarely limited to just
                post-production. Many editors are involved in pre-production, helping to plan the shots with the end
                product in mind, and many more are on set during production to ensure the director and crew are getting
                all of the footage they need to knit the story together visually.</p>

            <p>But, of course, it’s in the editing room, after all the cameras have stopped rolling, that editors begin
                their true work. And yes, that work involves selecting what shots to use and how to use them, but more
                importantly, editing is where the grammar and syntax of cinematic language really come together. Just as
                linguistic meaning is built up from a set sequence of words, phrases, and sentences, cinematic meaning
                is built up from a sequence of shots and scenes. A word (or a shot) in isolation may have a certain
                semantic content, but it is the juxtaposition of that word (or shot) in a sentence (or scene) that gives
                it its full power to communicate. As such, editing is fundamental to how cinema communicates with an
                audience. And just as it is with any other language, much of its power comes from the fact that we
                rarely notice how it works; the mechanism is second nature, intuitive, and invisible.</p>

            <p>But before we get to the nuts of bolts of how editors put together cinema, let’s look at how the art of
                editing has evolved over the past century. To do that, we have to go back to the beginning. And we have
                to go to Russia.</p>



            <p>As you may recall, the earliest motion pictures were often single-take
                <em>actualit</em><em>é</em><em>s</em>, unedited views of a man sneezing, workers leaving a factory, or a
                train pulling into a station. It took a few years before filmmakers understood the storytelling power of
                the medium before they realized there was such a thing as cinematic language. Filmmakers like Georges
                Melies seemed to catch on quickly, not only using mise-en-scene and in-camera special effects but also
                employing the edit, the joining together of discrete shots in a sequence to tell a story. However, it
                was the Russians, in this early period, that focused specifically on editing as the essence of cinema.
                And one Russian in particular, <strong>Lev Kuleshov</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Lev Kuleshov was an art school dropout living in Moscow when he directed his first film in 1917. He was
                only 18 years old. By the time he was 20, he had helped found one of the first film schools in the world
                in Moscow. He was keenly interested in film theory, more specifically, film editing and how it worked on
                an audience. He had a hunch that the power of cinema was not found in any one shot but in the
                <em>juxtaposition</em> of shots. So, he performed an experiment. He cut together a short film and showed
                it to audiences in 1918. Here’s the film:
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>After viewing the film, the audience raved about the actor and his performance (he was a very famous
                actor in Russia at the time). They praised the subtly with which he expressed his aching hunger upon
                viewing the soup, the mournful sadness upon seeing the child in a coffin, and the longing desire upon
                seeing the scantily clad woman. The only problem? It was the exact same shot of the actor every time!
                The audience was projecting their own emotion and meaning onto the actor’s expression because of the
                juxtaposition of the other images. This phenomenon – how we derive more meaning from the juxtaposition
                of two shots than from any single shot in isolation – became known as <strong>The Kuleshov
                    Effect</strong>.</p>

            <p>Other Russian filmmakers took up this fascination with how editing works on an audience, both emotionally
                and psychologically, and developed an approach to filmmaking known as the <strong>Soviet Montage
                    Movement</strong>. Montage is simply the French term for “assembly” or “editing” (even the Russians
                had to borrow words from the French!), but Russian filmmakers of the 1920s were pushing the boundaries
                of what was possible, testing the limits of the Kuleshov Effect. And in the process, they were
                accelerating the evolution of cinematic language, bringing a sophisticated complexity to how cinema
                communicates meaning.</p>

            <p>The most famous of these early proponents of the Soviet Montage Movement was <strong>Sergei
                    Eisenstein</strong>. Once a student of Kuleshov’s (though actually a year older), Eisenstein would
                become one of the most prolific members of the movement. Perhaps his most well-known film, Battleship
                Potemkin (1925), contains a sequence that has become one of the most famous examples of Soviet montage
                and, frankly, one of the most famous sequences in the cinema period. It’s known as <strong>The Odessa
                    Steps Sequence</strong>. You may remember it from Chapter One. Let’s take another look:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget86"

                </div>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-v-kZzfec" target="_blank" class="video-fallback-link">Watch
                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>One thing you might notice about that sequence is that it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, at least in
                terms of a logical narrative. However, Eisenstein was more interested in creating an emotional effect.
                And he does it by juxtaposing images of violence with images of innocence, repeating images and shots,
                lingering on some images, and flashing on others. He wants you to <em>feel </em>the terror of those
                peasants being massacred by the troops, even if you don’t completely understand the geography or linear
                sequence of events. That’s the power of the montage as Eisenstein used it: A collage of moving images
                designed to create an emotional effect rather than a logical narrative sequence.</p>



            <p>In the hundred or so years since Kuleshov and Eisenstein, we’ve learned a lot about how editing works,
                both as filmmakers and as audience members. In fact, we know it so well we hardly have to give it much
                thought. We’ve fully accepted the idea that cinema uses editing to not only manipulate our emotions
                through techniques like the Kuleshov Effect but also to manipulate space and time itself. When a film or
                TV episode cuts from one location to another, we rarely wonder whether the characters on screen
                teleported or otherwise broke the laws of physics (unless, of course, it’s a film about wizards). We
                intuitively understand that edits allow the camera – and, by implication, the viewer – to jump across
                space and across time to keep the story moving at a steady clip.</p>

            <p>The most obvious example of this is the <strong>ellipsis</strong>, an edit that slices out time or events
                we don’t <em>need</em> to see to follow the story. Imagine a scene where a car pulls up in front of a
                house and then cuts to a woman at the door ringing the doorbell. We don’t <em>need</em> to spend the
                screen time watching her shut off the car, climb out, shut and lock the door, and walk all the way up to
                the house. The cut is an ellipsis, and none of us will wonder if she somehow teleported from her car to
                the front door (unless, again, she’s a wizard). And if you think about it for a moment, you’ll realize
                ellipses are crucial to telling a story cinematically. If we had to show every moment in every
                character’s experience, films would take years or even decades to make, much less watch!</p>

            <p>Other ways cinema manipulates time include sequences like <strong>flashbacks </strong>and
                <strong>flashforwards</strong>. Filmmakers use these when they want to show events from a character’s
                past or foreshadow what’s coming in the future. They’re also a great indicator of how far cinematic
                language has evolved over time. Back in the Golden Age of Hollywood, when editors were first
                experimenting with techniques like flashbacks, they needed ways to signal to the audience, “Hey, we’re
                about to go back in time!” They would employ music – usually harp music (I’m not sure why, but it was a
                thing) – and visual cues like blurred focus or warped images to indicate a flashback. As audiences
                became more fluent in this new addition to cinematic language, they didn’t need the visual cues anymore.
                Today, movies often move backward and forward in time, trusting the audience to “read” the scene in its
                proper context without any prompts. Think of films like Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Pulp Fiction
                </em>(1994), which plays with time throughout, rearranging the sequence of events in the plot for
                dramatic effect and forcing the viewer to keep up. Or a more recent film like Greta Gerwig’s adaptation
                of <em>Little Women</em> (2019), which also moves backward and forwards in time, hinting at the shift
                through mise-en-scène and subtle changes in performance.
            </p>

            <p>Another more subtle way editing manipulates time is in the overall <strong>rhythm</strong> of the
                cinematic experience. And no, I don’t mean the music, though, that can help. I mean the pace of the
                finished film, how the edits speed up or slow down to serve the story, producing a rhythm to the edit.
            </p>

            <p>Take the work of Kelly Reichardt, for example. As both director and editor on almost all of her films,
                she creates a specific rhythm that echoes the time and space of her characters:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget88"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/avlWhOxnlMU" title="Kelly Reichardt: 'Elaborated Time'"
                        width="100%" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>
                </div>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avlWhOxnlMU" target="_blank" class="video-fallback-link">Watch
                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>Sometimes, an editor lets each shot play out, giving plenty of space between the cuts, creating a slow,
                even rhythm to a scene. Or they might cut from image to image quickly, letting each flash across the
                screen for mere moments, creating a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat rhythm. In either case, the editor has
                to consider how long do we <em>need</em> to see each shot. In fact, there’s a scientific term for how
                long it takes us to register visual information: the <strong>content curve</strong>. A relatively simple
                shot of a child’s smile might have a very short content curve. A more complex shot with multiple planes
                of view and maybe even text to read would have a much longer content curve. Editing is all about
                balancing the content curve with the needs of the story and the intent of the director for the overall
                rhythm of each scene and the finished film as a whole.</p>

            <p>This is why editing is much more than simply assembling the shots. It is an art that requires an
                intuitive sense of how a scene, sequence, and finished film should move and how it should feel. Most
                editors describe their process as both technical and intuitive, requiring thinking <em>and </em>feeling:
            </p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">

            <p>Maybe it’s obvious, but if editing is where the grammar and syntax of cinematic language come together,
                then the whole point is to make whatever we see on screen make as much sense as possible. Just like a
                writer wants to draw the reader into the story, not remind them they’re reading a book, an editor’s job,
                first and foremost, is to draw the viewer into the cinematic experience, not remind them they’re
                watching a movie. (Unless that’s exactly what the filmmaker wants to do, but more on that later.) The
                last thing most editors want to do is draw attention to the editing itself. We call this approach to
                editing <strong>continuity editing</strong>, or more to the point, <strong>invisible editing</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Continually editing aims to create a continuous flow of images and sound, a linear, logical progression,
                shot to shot and scene to scene, constantly orienting the viewer in space and time and carrying them
                through the narrative. All without ever making any of that obvious or obtrusive. It involves a number of
                different techniques, from cutting-on-action to match cuts and transitions and from maintaining screen
                direction to the master shot and coverage technique and the 180-degree rule. Let’s take a look at these
                and other tricks editors use to hide their handiwork.</p>

            <h3>Cutting on Action</h3>

            <p>The first problem an editor faces is how and when to cut from one shot to the next without disorienting
                the viewer or breaking continuity, that is, the continuous flow of the narrative. Back in Chapter Two, I
                discussed one of the most common techniques is to “hide” the cut in the middle of some on-screen action.
                Called, appropriately enough, <strong>cutting-on-action</strong>, the trick is to end one shot in the
                middle of an action – a character sitting down in a chair or climbing into a car – and start the next in
                the middle of the same action. Our eyes are drawn to the action on screen and not the cut itself. The
                edit disappears as we track the movement of the character. Here’s a quick example:</p>

            <p>The two shots are radically different in terms of the geography of the scene – one outside of the truck,
                the other inside – but by cutting on the action of the character entering the truck, it <em>feels</em>
                like one continuous moment. Of course, we notice the cut, but it does not distract us from the scene or
                call attention to itself.</p>

            <p>And now that you know what to look for, you’ll see this technique used in just about every film or tv
                show, over and over, <em>all the time</em>.</p>

            <h3>Match Cuts</h3>

            <p>Cutting-on-action is arguably the most common continuity editing trick, but there are plenty of other
                cuts that use the technique of matching some visual element between two contiguous shots, also known as
                a <strong>match cut</strong>. There are <strong>eyeline match cuts</strong> that cut from a shot of a
                character looking off camera to a shot of whatever it is they are looking at, <strong>graphic match
                    cuts</strong> that cut between two images that look similar (the barrel of a gun to James Bond in an
                underground tunnel, for example), and even <strong>subject match cuts</strong> that cut between two
                similar ideas or concepts (a flame from a matchstick to the sun rising over the desert in David Lean’s
                <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> (1962)).
            </p>

            <p>Almost all of these examples rely on a hard cut from one shot to the next, but sometimes an editor simply
                can’t hide the edit with some matching action, image or idea. Instead, they have to transition the
                viewer from one shot to the next, or one scene to the next, in the most organic, unobtrusive way
                possible. We call these, well, <strong>transitions</strong>. As discussed in Chapter Two, you can think
                of these as conjunctions in grammar, words meant to connect ideas seamlessly. The more obvious examples,
                like <strong>fade-ins</strong> and <strong>fade-outs</strong> or long <strong>dissolves</strong>, are
                drawn from our own experience. A slow fade-out, where the screen drifts into blackness, reflects our
                experience of falling asleep and drifting out of consciousness. And dissolves, where one shot blends
                into the next, reflecting how one moment bleeds into and overlaps with another in our memory. But some
                transitions, like <strong>wipes </strong>and <strong>iris outs</strong>, are peculiar to motion pictures
                and have no relation to how we normally see the world. Sure, they might “call attention to themselves,”
                but somehow, they still do the trick, moving the viewer from one shot or scene to the next without
                distracting from the story itself.</p>

            <p>Wondering what some of these match cuts and transitions look like? Check out several examples of each
                (along with some not-so-invisible edits like <strong>jump </strong>cuts) here:</p>

            <h3>Screen Direction</h3>

            <p>Maintaining consistent <strong>screen direction</strong> is another technique editors use to keep us
                focused on the story and keep their work invisible. Take a look at this scene from Casablanca:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">

            </div>

            <p>We are entering the main setting for the film, a crowded, somewhat chaotic tavern in Morocco. Notice how
                the camera moves consistently from right to left and that the blocking of the actors (that is, how they
                move in the frame) is also predominantly from right to left until we settle on the piano player, Sam.
                The flow of images introduces the tavern as if the viewer were entering as a patron for the first time.
                This consistent screen direction helps establish the geography of the scene, orienting the viewer to the
                physical space. An editor concerned about continuity never wants the audience to ask, “Where are we?” or
                “What’s going on?” And obviously, this isn’t something an editor can do after the fact all by
                themselves. It requires a plan from the beginning, with the director, the cinematographer, the
                production designer, and the editor all working together to ensure they have the moving images they need
                to execute the scene.</p>

            <p>Some filmmakers can take this commitment to consistent screen direction to the extreme to serve the
                narrative and emphasize a theme. Check out this analysis of Bong Joon-ho’s <em>Snowpiercer</em> (2013):

            </div>

            <h3>Master Shot and Coverage</h3>

            <p>Consistent screen direction is an important part of how continuity editing ensures the audience is always
                aware of where everyone is located in relation to the setting and each other. Another common technique
                to achieve the same goal is to approach each scene with a <strong>master shot and coverage</strong>.</p>

            <p>The idea is fairly simple. On set during production, the filmmaker films a scene from one, wide
                <strong>master shot</strong> that includes all of the actors and action in one frame from start to
                finish. Then, they film <strong>coverage</strong>, that is, they “cover” that same scene from multiple
                angles, isolating characters, moving in closer, and almost always filming the entire scene again from
                start to finish with each new set-up. When they’re done, they have filmed the entire scene many, many
                times from many different perspectives.
            </p>

            <p>And that’s where the editor comes in.</p>

            <p>It’s the editor’s job to build the scene from that raw material, usually starting with the <strong>master
                    shot</strong> to establish the geography of the scene, then cutting to the <strong>coverage</strong>
                as the scene plays out, using the best takes and angles to express the thematic intent. They can stay on
                each character for their lines of dialogue or cut to another character for a reaction. They can also cut
                back to the master shot whenever they choose to re-establish the geography or re-set the tone of the
                scene. But maybe most importantly, by having so many options, the editor can cut around poor
                performances or condense the scene by dropping lines of dialogue between edits. Done well, the viewer is
                drawn into the interaction of the characters, never stopping to ask where they are or who is talking to
                whom, and hopefully never even noticing a cut.</p>

            <p>Let’s take a look at a scene from Damien Chazelle’s <em>Whiplash </em>(2014), shot and edited in the
                classic master shot and coverage technique:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">

                </div>

                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>The scene opens with a master shot. We see both characters, Andrew and Nicole, in the same frame, sitting
                at a table in a café. The next shot is from the coverage, over Nicole’s shoulder, on Andrew as he reacts
                to her first line of dialogue. Then on, Nicole, over Andrew’s shoulder as she reacts to his line. The
                editor, Tom Cross, moves back and forth between these two shots until Andrew asks a question tied to the
                film’s main theme, “What do you do?” Then he switches to close-up coverage of the two characters.
                Tension builds until there is a subtle clash between them, a moment of conflict. And what does the
                editor do? He cuts back to the master shot, resetting the scene emotionally and reorienting the viewer
                to the space. The two characters begin to reconnect, and the editor returns to the coverage, again
                shifting to close-ups until the two find a point of connection (symbolized by an <strong>insert
                    shot</strong> of their shoes gently touching). The rhythm of this scene is built from the raw
                materials, the master shot and the coverage, that the editor has to work with. But more than just
                presenting the scene as written, the editor has the power to emphasize the storytelling by when to cut
                and what shots to use.</p>

            <p>The master shot and coverage technique gives the editor an incredible amount of freedom to shape a scene,
                but there is one thing they <em>can’t</em> do. A rule they must follow. And I don’t mean one of those
                artistic rules that are meant to be broken. Break this rule, and it will break the continuity of any
                scene. It’s called the <strong>180 degree rule</strong> and it’s related to the master shot and coverage
                technique.</p>

            <p>Basically, the 180-degree rule defines an <strong>axis of action</strong>, an imaginary line that runs
                through the characters in a scene that the camera <em>cannot</em> cross:</p>

            <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: auto; margin: auto; text-align: center;"><a
                    href="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156780/180-degree-rule.jpg"><img
                        alt="180 degree rule diagram"
                        src="https://human.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/156780/180-degree-rule.jpg"
                        style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /> </a></div>

            <p>Once the master shot establishes which side of the action the camera will capture, the coverage must stay
                on that side throughout the scene. The camera can rotate 180 degrees around its subject, but if it
                crosses that imaginary line and inches past 180 degrees, the subjects in the frame will reverse
                positions and will no longer be looking at each other from shot to shot. Take a look at that scene from
                Whiplash again. Notice how the master shot establishes the camera on Andrew’s left and Nicole’s right.
                Every subsequent angle of coverage stays on that side of the table, Andrew always looking right to the
                left, and Nicole always looking left to the right. If the camera were to <strong>jump the line</strong>,
                Andrew would appear to be looking in the opposite direction, confusing the viewer and breaking
                continuity.</p>

            <p>Now, I know I just wrote that this is not one of those artistic rules that was meant to be broken. But
                the fact is, editors <em>can </em>break the rule if they actually <em>want </em>to disorient the viewer,
                to put them into the psychology of a character or scene. Or if they need to jump the line to keep the
                narrative going, they can use a new master shot to reorient the axis of action.</p>

            <h3>Parallel Editing</h3>

            <p>All of these techniques, cutting-on-action, match cuts, transitions, consistent screen direction, and the
                master shot and coverage technique, are all ways that editors can keep their craft invisible and
                maintain continuity. But what does an editor do when there is more than one narrative playing out at the
                same time? How do you show both <em>and</em> maintain continuity? One solution is to use
                <strong>cross-cutting</strong>, cutting back and forth between two or more narratives, also known as
                <strong>parallel editing</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Parallel editing has actually been around for quite some time. Perhaps one of the most famous early
                examples is from D. W. Griffith’s <em>Way Down East</em> (1920). Kuleshov had already demonstrated the
                power of juxtaposing shots to create an emotional effect. But Griffith, among others, showed that you
                could also create a sense of thrilling anxiety by juxtaposing two or more lines of action, cross-cutting
                from one to another in a rhythmic pattern. In a climactic scene from the film<em>,</em> a man races to
                save a woman adrift on a frozen river and heading straight for a dangerous waterfall. To establish these
                lines of action and to increase our own sense of dread and anxiety, the editor cuts from the man to the
                woman to the waterfall in a regular, rhythmic pattern, cross-cutting between them to constantly remind
                the audience of the impending doom as we cheer on our hero until the lines of action finally converge.
                Here’s the scene:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget102"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBl1UxwEpHI" title="Way Down East - Waterfall Rescue"

                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>By cross-cutting in a regular pattern – man, woman, man, waterfall, woman, man, woman, waterfall – the
                audience is not only drawn into the action, they are also no longer paying attention to the editing
                itself, thus maintaining continuity.</p>

            <p>This technique has become so common, so integral to our shared cinematic language, that editors can use
                our fluency against us, subverting expectations by playing with the form. Check out this (rather
                disturbing) clip from Jonathan Demme’s <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em> (1991):</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 325px;">
                    <iframe enablejsapi="true" height="325" id="widget104"

                    on YouTube</a>
            </div>

            <p>The scene uses the same parallel editing technique as <em>Way Down East</em>, using cross-cutting to
                increase our anxiety as two lines of action converge. But in this case, the editor subverts our
                expectations by revealing there were actually <em>three</em> lines of action, not two. However, the
                trick only works if parallel action is already part of our cinematic language.</p>
