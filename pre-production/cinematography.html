        <h1>Cinematography</h1>
        <div class="textbook-content">

            <div class="art-banner-wrap">&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Photography is the art of fixing an image in durable form through either a chemical or digital process.
                It requires a detailed, scientific knowledge of how light reflects off the lived environment and how
                that light reacts to various light-sensitive media. It also requires a sophisticated grasp of color
                temperature and the interplay of light and shadow. An artist’s sensibility to composition, the
                arrangement of objects, and setting within the camera's frame to achieve balance and visual interest.
                Not to mention a deep, technical understanding of the gear required, cameras, formats, lenses, and their
                respective idiosyncrasies. And it helps if you know how to tell a story in a single image, frozen in
                time. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>

            <p>Now, do that at least 24 times every second.</p>

            <p>That’s <em>cinema</em>tography: Capturing the moving image.</p>

            <p>For many film lovers and even just the casual viewer, this is what we show up for. But I’ve waited five
                chapters to discuss it because it’s important to understand that cinematography – while it may often get
                the most glory – is only one part of how cinema works. Without a sophisticated mise-en-scéne and a
                narrative to follow, it’s just a bunch of meaningless images. Not to mention the importance of editing,
                sound, and performance. Put it all together, cinematography is the anchor point to a much larger
                cinematic experience.</p>

            <p>The person responsible for all of this is the <strong>cinematographer</strong>, sometimes known as the
                <strong>director of photography (DP)</strong>. Their job is to translate the director’s vision into
                usable footage, using all of the photographic skills listed above and only after making a series of
                crucial decisions, which we will get to below. It is one of the most technical jobs in cinema, requiring
                as much science as it does art:

            <p>And just as the production designer oversees a whole crew of craftspeople helping to fully realize the
                mise-en-scéne, the cinematographer also relies on a large team known as the <strong>camera
                    department</strong><em>. </em>The camera department includes the <strong>camera operator</strong>,
                the person actually handling the camera. I know; it seems like that should be the cinematographer. And
                it often is. However, on larger productions with multiple cameras or very complex shots, the
                cinematographer can only be in one place at a time. There’s also the <strong>1st assistant camera (1st
                    AC)</strong>, which is responsible for the camera components, swapping out lenses, and, most
                importantly, keeping the camera in focus. However, that last job is sometimes given to another dedicated
                member of the team, the <strong>focus puller</strong>. Then you have the <strong>2nd assistant camera
                    (2nd AC),</strong> who assists the 1st AC and often operates the <strong>slate</strong> or
                <strong>clapper </strong>(more on that later).
            </p>

            <p>A relatively new member of the camera department is the <strong>Digital Imaging Technician
                    (DIT)</strong>. With the rise of digital cinematography, instead of a dedicated person responsible
                for loading film onto the camera (known as a <strong>film loader</strong>, so creative with the names),
                we now have a person solely responsible for organizing the digital files coming off the camera. That can
                include quality control and <strong>color correction</strong> during the shoot.</p>

            <p>Outside the dedicated camera department, the cinematographer also oversees the <strong>lighting
                    department</strong> as well as the <strong>grip department</strong>, also known collectively as
                <strong>grip and electric</strong>. The lighting department is, well, responsible for all the lights
                required to shoot a scene. As should be obvious, lights require electricity. Electricity can be
                dangerous, especially when 100 crew members are running around trying to get a shot before lunch. So,
                the head of the lighting department is a skilled electrician known as the <strong>gaffer</strong>. The
                gaffer has a first assistant as well, called the <strong>best boy</strong>. (I know, not very
                gender-neutral. If the “best boy” is female, they might be called <strong>best babe</strong>, which is
                worse.) And then a whole crew of <strong>electrics</strong> is responsible for putting the lights
                wherever the gaffer tells them to. <strong>Grips</strong> are there to move everything else that
                <em>isn’t</em> a light. That includes lighting stands, flags, bounces, even cranes, dollies, and the
                camera itself. The head of the grip department is the <strong>key grip</strong>, and one of their most
                important jobs is on-set safety. With so many literal moving parts, it is very easy for someone to get
                hurt.
            </p>

            <p>That’s a lot of people to keep track of for one cinematographer, but fortunately, there is a tightly
                controlled hierarchy, and they all know their jobs. A simple command from the cinematographer, “Flag off
                that 10k, we’re going wide on the dolly,” may sound like gibberish, but everyone on a film set knows
                exactly what to do. In fact, there’s a whole cinema-specific vocabulary that film crews use to keep the
                shoot moving quickly and efficiently. From <strong>apple boxes </strong>to <strong>barn doors</strong>
                to <strong>C-stands</strong>, the lingo can get downright bizarre. Clothespins are not clothespins;
                they’re <strong>C-47s </strong>(and yes, <u><a href="http://www.scoutingny.com/its-called-a-c-47-dummy/"
                        target="_blank">they use a lot of clothespins on a film set</a></u>), and breakfast isn’t the
                morning meal; it’s the first meal on set, which could be 6 o’clock in the evening. And if someone is in
                the bathroom, they’re <strong>10-100 </strong>(or <strong>10-200</strong> as the case may be), but
                they’re definitely <em>not </em><strong>“in the can”</strong>, which is what you say when a scene is
                completed.</p>

            <p>But aside from the esoteric lingo on the set, there are a few key terms everyone should know. The first
                is the <strong>shot</strong>, the most basic building block of cinematography. As mentioned in Chapter
                Two, a shot is one continuous capture of a span of action by a motion picture camera. A finished film is
                made up of a series of these shots of varying lengths, that ultimately tell the story. But during
                production, each shot may need to be repeated several (or dozens or even hundreds of) times until
                everyone gets it right. Every time they repeat the shot, it’s called a <strong>take</strong>. And once
                the director and cinematographer feel they have the best version of that shot, it’s time to move the
                camera – and everything associated with it – to a new shot, sometimes just a slightly different angle on
                the same scene. That’s called a <strong>set-up</strong>. New set-ups require everyone on the crew to
                jump into action, rearranging the camera, the lights, the set dressing, etc. That can take time. Lots of
                time. And it’s one reason assistant directors, responsible for planning how long it will all take, think
                of the schedule in terms of the number of set-ups a crew can accomplish each day.</p>

            <p>Obviously, a film set is a complicated place requiring a complex choreography of dozens, if not hundreds,
                of personnel all dedicated to rendering the moving picture. But there are many decisions a
                cinematographer has to make before they even arrive on set. These decisions – film or digital, black and
                white or color, lighting, lenses, framing, and movement – are all made in collaboration with the
                director and in service to the narrative and the overall mise-en-scéne. Some of them are incredibly
                technical, and some are purely aesthetic, but each one of them will affect how we engage in the
                cinematic experience.</p>

            <p>One of the first decisions a cinematographer must make is what medium she intends to use to record the
                images: a physical film stock or a digital sensor. While this is a highly technical decision, it is also
                an important aesthetic choice that will affect the overall look of the final image. Not only are there
                differences in the look of film versus digital recording generally, but there are also subtle
                distinctions in the various film stocks and manufacturers, as well as the different types of digital
                sensors that come with different camera systems. Let’s take each one in turn.</p>

            <p>Good old-fashioned film stock has been around since the dawn of cinema, though it has evolved quite a bit
                since those early days. In the beginning, the strips of light-sensitive material were made from nitrate,
                a highly flammable material, which was not so great when it was whirring through a projector past a hot
                lamp. It’s one of the reasons many early films are lost to history. They simply burned up too easily.
                Today, film stock is made from a much sturdier plastic. And on that plastic is a gelatin coating
                containing thousands of microscopic grains of light-sensitive crystals called <strong>silver
                    halide</strong>. When light hits those crystals, they darken, depending on the amount of light. (And
                if it’s a color film, there will be three separate layers of those crystals, one blue, one red, and one
                green.) A chemical bath enhances that reaction to light, rendering a negative image that can then be
                projected.</p>

            <p>Once a cinematographer commits to this analog, chemical process, there are still a lot of decisions to
                make. First, they must choose a <strong>film gauge</strong>, that is, the size of the film stock. The
                film gauge is determined by measuring from corner to corner the individual frames that will be exposed
                to light. The standard film gauge in cinema today is 35mm, but sizes range from as small as 8mm all the
                way up to 70mm. And each size will render a different look, with more or less detail once enlarged. They
                must also decide how sensitive the film will be to light. Highly sensitive, or “fast” film stock, that
                is, a film that reacts quickly to relatively low levels of light, contains relatively large silver
                halide crystals (more surface area to absorb the light). The benefit is the ability to film at night or
                in other low-light situations. The drawback is a loss in <strong>resolution</strong> or detail in the
                image due to an increase in the crystals. Or <strong>grain</strong>. Less sensitive, or “slower” film
                stock produces a crisper image (due to the smaller crystals) but requires more light.</p>

            <p>There are many other decisions to be made that may affect the final image – the manufacturer, black and
                white versus color, the developing process – but using the physical medium of film stock renders an
                image that many filmmakers claim has a more organic look, a difference you can almost feel more than
                see. And that comes at a price. Film stock must be purchased by the foot, forcing filmmakers to plan
                every shot carefully to avoid wasting material. (Of course, many filmmakers see this as a <em>good
                </em>thing). Not to mention the fact that you don’t <em>really</em> know what you have until you develop
                the film after a day of shooting. Or the fact that you have to assemble your final film by actually
                cutting and taping together physical strips of film. Or the fact that even if you choose to shoot on
                analog film stock, most of your audience is going to watch a digitized version in the multiplex or on
                their television, laptop or smartphone anyway.</p>

            <p>For these and many other reasons, the good old-fashioned film has fallen somewhat out of fashion in favor
                of the flexibility of <strong>digital cinematography</strong>. Digital cinematography is identical in
                every way to analog film cinematography – same basic equipment, same need to control exposure, shape
                light, compose the image, etc. – with one important difference: the light passing through the lens hits
                a digital image sensor instead of a strip of plastic film. That sensor uses software to analyze and
                convert the light bouncing off its surface into a series of still images (just like film stock) that are
                recorded onto flash memory or an external hard drive.</p>

            <p>The advantages should be obvious. First and foremost, there are almost no limits on how much you can
                record, especially as digital data storage becomes cheaper and cheaper. And since the sensor is
                controlled by software, you can adjust settings such as light sensitivity at the press of a button
                rather than changing out the film stock.</p>

            <p>But there are still lots of decisions to be made. Just as there are various film gauges, digital sensors
                come in all shapes and sizes, and every camera manufacturer produces their own subtle variations. And
                while most of us could probably never tell the difference, cinematographers are very particular about
                the way a Canon sensor renders color differently from a Sony sensor or a RED sensor from an Arri sensor.
            </p>

            <p>And then there’s the issue of resolution. The standard for “high definition” is an image measuring 1,920
                pixels by 1,080 pixels, also known as <strong>1080p</strong> (the “p” stands for progressive scan since
                the image is rendered line by line from top to bottom). Pixels are the smallest visible unit in a
                screen’s ability to produce an image. Think of them as analogous to those tiny silver halide crystals in
                film stock. 1,920 by 1,080 pixels is a lot of detail, but most digital cinema today is recorded at a
                much higher resolution of at least 4,096 pixels by 2,160 pixels, or <strong>4K</strong>. And even that
                has become commonplace and somewhat outdated. In fact, you probably have a 4K camera in your pocket
                right now. It’s on your phone. As the technology improves, we’ll see 6K, 8K, and 10K become standard.
                All that information packed into every image renders an incredible amount of detail (and also eats up a
                lot of storage space). Detail most of us, frankly, will not be able to see with the naked eye.</p>

            <p>But resolution isn’t the only factor that affects image clarity. Cinematographers can also manipulate the
                <strong>frame rate</strong> to render super-sharp imagery. For decades, the standard frame rate for
                cinema has been 24 frames per second. That produces a familiar, cinematic “look” to the finished film in
                part because of <strong><u><a href="https://frames-per-second.appspot.com/" target="_blank">motion
                            blur</a></u></strong>, the subtle blurring that occurs between still images passing at 24
                fps. But film shot and projected at 48, 96, or even 120 frames per second renders an ultra-sharp image
                with almost no motion blur as our brains process far more detail between each individual frame. To be
                fair, this is possible with analog film stock, but it is impractical to shoot that much film stock at
                that high a rate. Digital cinematography gives filmmakers like Ang Lee (<em>Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime
                    Walk</em> (2016), <em>Gemini Man </em>(2019)) and James Cameron (the <em>Avatar</em> series) the
                freedom to experiment with these higher frame rates combined with higher resolution sensors to produce
                images we literally have never seen before.
            </p>

            <p>Another decision cinematographers must make early in the process, in collaboration with the director, is
                whether to record the image in black and white or color. For many of you, this may seem more a question
                of history. Old movies are black and white; modern movies are in color. Once the technology allowed for
                color cinematography, why would anyone look back? But there are a number of reasons why a filmmaker
                might <em>choose</em> to film in black and white over color, even today. They may want to evoke a
                certain period or emulate some of those “old” movies. Or, if the subject matter is relatively bleak,
                they may want the added thematic element of literally draining the color from the image. Or they may
                want to take advantage of the heightened reality and sharp contrast that black-and-white cinematography
                provides. Or maybe they want to foreground the performances. One of the greatest directors in cinema
                history, Orson Welles, once said black and white was the actor’s friend because every performance is
                better without the distraction of color.</p>

            <p>But I get it. It’s not 1920. You don’t ride a penny-farthing or listen to music on wax cylinders. Why
                would you watch a movie in black and white?</p>

            <p>Maybe this will convince you:</p>

            <p>Whatever their reason, cinematographers must take several things into account once they choose between
                black and white and color. First, if they are shooting black and white on film, they typically have to
                use a film stock designed for black and white imagery. It is possible to print black and white from a
                color negative, but it won’t render the light and shadows in quite the same way as a dedicated film
                stock. And, of course, if they are filming in color, different film stocks from different manufacturers
                will render colors differently depending on the desired effect. If they are using digital technology and
                want the final product to be black and white, the color is usually removed after filming in
                post-production. But they still have to balance lighting and exposure for how the image will render
                without color. In either case, it’s important to note that black-and-white cinematography requires just
                as much attention to detail in the filming process as color.</p>

            <p>Whether shooting film or digital, black and white or color, one of the most powerful tools a
                cinematographer has to work with is light itself; without light, there is no image, and there can be no
                cinema. But simply having enough light to expose an image is not enough. A great cinematographer – heck,
                even a halfway decent one – knows that their job is to shape that light into something uniquely
                cinematic. To do that, they must have a deep understanding of the basic properties of light. Four
                properties, to be specific: <strong>Source</strong>, <strong>Quality</strong>, <strong>Direction,
                </strong>and <strong>Color</strong>.</p>

            <p>The source refers to both the origin and intensity of the light. There are two basic distinctions in
                terms of origin: natural or artificial. <strong>Natural light</strong> refers to light from the sun or
                moon (which is really just the sun bouncing off the moon, but you knew that), and <strong>artificial
                    light</strong> refers to light generated from any number of different technologies, LED,
                incandescent, fluorescent, etc. Each source will have its own particular characteristics, exposing a
                shot in its own particular way. Artificial light allows a cinematographer an incredible amount of
                freedom to manipulate and shape the light. Scenes shot indoors on a soundstage can be made to look like
                daytime exteriors with enough artificial light. Scenes shot outdoors at night can also be augmented with
                artificial lights standing in for moonlight. But natural light can also be manipulated and shaped
                through filters, flags (large black fabric squares used to block off the sun’s direct light), and
                diffusers.</p>

            <p>Each new scene will require the cinematographer to consider their light source and how they want to shape
                it. And a big part of that calculation is <strong>intensity</strong>. How bright is the source, and how
                is that going to affect exposure? We’ll discuss <strong>depth of field</strong> later on, but how much
                light a cinematographer has to work with affects how much (or how little) of the shot can be in focus
                and how balanced their exposure will be in the final image. Sometimes a cinematographer can get away
                with just using <strong>available light</strong>, that is, the light from the pre-existing fixtures in a
                location (also called <strong>practical lights</strong>). But more often, they want to control the
                intensity more precisely, so they use specialized lights to illuminate the scene from outside the frame
                of the image. The lamps and overhead lights you might see in a film or TV series are actually more props
                than true lighting sources. They indicate to the viewer where the light is coming from in a given shot –
                what cinematographers call <strong>motivating</strong> the light source and direction – but they rarely
                add anything to the exposure of the scene.</p>

            <p>The subject in the scene is lit by several bright artificial lights just off camera. The table lamp in
                the background is only there to “motivate” the light that illuminates the side of the subject’s face.
                But it’s really just a psychological trick. If you really think about it, a dim lamp behind and to the
                right of the subject should not illuminate his face at all, but our brain tells us, “Sure, that makes
                sense.” That’s because we really <em>want</em> to believe; we don’t want to think about a crew of people
                standing around bright lights while a camera records it all. We want to be fooled, and the
                cinematographer knows that.</p>

            <p>The second property of light cinematographers have to think about is quality. This doesn’t mean “good” or
                “bad,” it’s more about how the light “feels” in the shot. The easiest way to think about quality is in
                terms of <strong>hard</strong> or <strong>soft</strong> lighting. Hard lighting is intense and focused,
                creating harsh, dramatic shadows. Soft lighting is more diffused and even, filling the space with
                smooth, gradual transitions from light to dark. The difference is actually less about the light on the
                subject and more about the shadows cast by the subject. Are the shadows clearly defined with a hard
                edge? You’ve got hard lighting. Are the shadows fuzzy, less clearly defined, or maybe even absent
                entirely? You’ve got soft lighting. Cinematographers can control the quality of light by adjusting the
                size of the light source and its distance from the subject. Typically, the smaller the light source and
                the closer to the subject, the harder the light:</p>

            </div>

            <p>The third important property of light is direction. Where is the light coming from in the scene? Not the
                source, what <em>makes </em>the light, but what <em>direction</em> is it coming from? Left, right,
                below, above? Each decision will affect the look and feel of a scene, and practical lights in the set
                design can help motivate lighting direction. A single overhead lamp in an interrogation room will
                motivate a hard light from above. Large windows can help motivate a soft, diffused light from one side
                of the room.</p>

            <p>Cinematographers plan their lighting set-up for any given scene by thinking carefully about what
                direction the light is coming from, starting with the main source of illumination, the <strong>key
                    light</strong>. The key light is usually the brightest light on the set, used to properly expose the
                main subject. But just one bright light will feel like a spotlight, creating unwanted shadows. So, they
                use a <strong>fill light</strong>, usually less intense and a bit softer than the key light, to fill out
                those shadows. But those two lights shining on the front of your subject can make the scene feel a bit
                two-dimensional. To bring some depth to the image, they use a <strong>backlight</strong>, usually a hard
                light that shines on the back of a subject’s head (also called a <strong>hair light</strong>), to create
                some separation between the subject and the background. The brightness of each of these lights relative
                to each other is known as the <strong>lighting ratio</strong> and can be adjusted for various different
                effects. This lighting setup is known as <strong>three-point lighting</strong>, and it’s the most basic
                starting point for lighting a scene:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

            </div>

            <p>Of course, three-point lighting is just that, a starting point. Really complex lighting schemes will
                require far more layers to the set-up. But even then, cinematographers will talk to their gaffers,
                electrics, and grips in terms of key, fill, and back lights.</p>

            <p>The fourth property of light that every cinematographer must understand is color. And no, I don’t mean
                red, blue, and green light bulbs. I mean the subtle color cast that different light sources give off
                that will ultimately affect the exposed image. For example, a typical household incandescent light bulb
                uses a tungsten filament to produce light. That light usually has a warm orange glow to it. But a
                fluorescent tube light in a ceiling fixture gives off a cooler, bluer light. In fact, we’ve come up with
                a way to measure these differences using the concept of <strong>color temperature</strong>. Color
                temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin. The lower the degree Kelvin, the warmer or more “red” the
                light. The higher the degree Kelvin, the cooler, the more “blue” the light. The orange glow of a
                tungsten bulb is around 3200 Kelvin. Daylight is around 5600 Kelvin.</p>

            <p>It can get a little confusing, I know. Check out this quick overview of the science behind color
                temperature and how we use it in cinema:</p>

            </div>

            <p>As should be clear by now, color temperature matters a great deal when a cinematographer wants to set a
                particular mood. For example, a romantic scene in a candle-lit restaurant should have a warm orange
                glow. Fortunately, you don’t need to rely on a thousand candles to achieve that effect. Most modern LED
                (light-emitting diode) lights can be adjusted according to color temperature. All you have to do is dial
                in 2000K to your key, fill, and backlights, and you get the equivalent of the warm glow of candlelight
                without the fire hazard.</p>

            <p>Source, quality, direction, and color are the four most important properties of light cinematographers
                must master to create great cinema. Once we understand these same properties, we can start to understand
                how cinematographers combine them to achieve an effective lighting <strong>style</strong> in any given
                scene, film, or series. For example, by lowering or removing the key light and relying more on indirect,
                relatively hard fill and backlights, you create deep shadows and high contrast in a scene. As mentioned
                in Chapter Three, this style of lighting is known as <strong>low-key lighting </strong>(because of the
                lack of a dominant key light, not because it’s laid back), used to evoke mystery and even terror.</p>

                he approaches lighting style in his work:</p>

            <p>Another powerful tool a cinematographer has to work with is, of course, the camera. And there is a lot
                that goes into how that particular apparatus works and the nuances between different formats and
                manufacturers. But I want to focus on the one component that is interchangeable and allows for endless
                variety: the <strong>lens</strong>. No matter what camera a cinematographer chooses, it’s the lens that
                determines the clarity, framing, depth of field, and exposure of the image. Just by changing the lens,
                without moving the camera at all, you can radically transform the look of a shot.</p>

            <p>The principle behind a camera lens is pretty simple. A piece of curved glass (or several pieces depending
                on the lens), held in place on the front of the camera, focuses light through an adjustable aperture (a
                fancy word for “hole”) and onto light-sensitive material (film or a digital sensor). The aperture
                controls the amount of light entering the camera, and the glass “elements” control the sharpness of the
                image by moving closer or further away in tiny increments from the aperture. The overall distance
                between the sensor and the point at which the light passes through those glass elements is called the
                <strong>focal length</strong> and is measured in millimeters. So, in a 50mm lens, the distance between
                the sensor of the camera and the point where the light passes through the glass of the lens is 50
                millimeters.
            </p>

            <p>The focal length determines both the <strong>angle of view</strong> and the
                <strong>magnification</strong> of the image. The shorter the focal length, the wider the angle of view
                and the smaller the magnification. The longer the focal length, the narrower the angle of view and the
                greater the magnification. Any lens below 35mm is generally considered a “wide-angle lens” because of
                its relatively short focal length. Any lens above 70mm is considered a “telephoto lens” because it
                greatly magnifies the image.
            </p>

            <p>Lenses can be divided into two basic types based on how they treat focal length: <strong>zoom
                </strong>and <strong>prime</strong>. Zoom lenses allow you to adjust the focal length by sliding the
                glass elements closer to or further away from the sensor, thus greatly magnifying the image or widening
                the angle of view without swapping out the lens itself. Prime lenses have a fixed focal length. What you
                see is what you get. Now I know what you’re thinking. Why not just slap a zoom lens on there and choose
                your own focal length? But actually, cinematographers almost always use prime lenses when filming. For
                one thing, zoom lenses tend to have many more glass elements than primes and that can affect the quality
                of the image. But more importantly, prime lenses force the cinematographer to be more deliberate and
                intentional about the angle of view and magnification of a particular shot.</p>

            <p>The angle of view and magnification is important in terms of what’s visible in the frame, but just as
                important is what appears to be in sharp focus. Lenses also allow cinematographers to control the depth
                of the image by either isolating a subject as the only element we see clearly in a particular shot or
                allowing us to see everything in the background and foreground equally. This is called <strong>depth of
                    field</strong>, the range of distance in front of the camera in which subjects are in sharp focus.

            <p>Note how the figure of the man lighting his cigarette is isolated from the background, focusing our
                attention on the spark from the lighter. This is an example of a <strong>narrow depth of field</strong>.
                The range of distance in front of the camera in which subjects are in sharp focus is relatively small,
                creating less depth in the image.</p>

            <p>Now check out this image:</p>

            <p>Note that everything seems to be equally in focus, allowing us to pick out all of the details of the set
                design. This is an example of a <strong>wide depth of field</strong> or <strong>deep focus</strong>.</p>

            <p>But since cinematography is all about <em>moving</em> pictures, this is not necessarily a binary choice.
                A cinematographer can <em>change</em> the depth of field within a shot to shift our attention from one
                subject to another. This is called a <strong>rack focus </strong>or <strong>pull focus:</strong></p>

            <p>Now that you know what it is, you’ll see it <em>all the time</em> in film and tv. In fact, there’s
                usually one person on set whose only job is to manage those shifts in the depth of field within a shot.
                They’re called, appropriately enough, a <strong>focus puller</strong>.</p>
