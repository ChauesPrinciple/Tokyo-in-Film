        <h1>The Script and Genre</h1>
        <div class="textbook-content">

            <p>Over the past century, cinema has evolved into an incredibly complex medium. We have massive IMAX
                screens, Dolby Atmos sound, and VR headsets. But one thing hasn't changed: the importance of a good
                story.</p>

            <p>No matter how innovative the visuals or how expensive the production design, if the specialized
                techniques of cinema aren't serving a compelling <strong>narrative</strong>, the audience will check
                out. Good storytelling has been around since we huddled around fires in caves. Cinema just gives us a
                new way to do it.</p>

            <h2>1.3.1 The Screenplay</h2>

            <p>Before a single frame is shot, the film exists on paper. The <strong>screenplay</strong> is the blueprint
                for the entire production. It is technical document, not a novel. It instructs the cast and crew on
                exactly what can be <em>seen</em> and <em>heard</em>.</p>

            <p>Screenplays follow a rigid format for a practical reason: <strong>One page equals roughly one minute of
                    screen time.</strong> This allows producers to look at a 120-page script and know "Okay, this is a
                two-hour movie." It allows them to budget the film and schedule the shoot.</p>

            <div class="script-sample"
                style="background: #fff; color: #000; padding: 2rem 3rem; font-family: 'Courier Prime', 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.1; margin: 2rem 0; box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-transform: uppercase;"><strong>EXT. SHIBUYA CROSSING -
                        NIGHT</strong></p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Rain hammers the asphalt. Neon lights reject the gloom. KENJI (20s,
                    disheveled) pushes through the crowd of umbrellas. He stops. He sees HER.</p>

                <div style="margin: 0 auto; width: 60%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">KENJI</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">(shouting)</p>
                    <p>I know you're in here!</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Passersby glance at him, then look away. A heavy silence amidst the
                    noise.</p>

                <div style="margin: 0 auto; width: 60%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">OFFICER (O.S.)</p>
                    <p>Hey! You!</p>
                </div>

                <p>Kenji bolts.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Notice the economy of language. The writer doesn't tell us Kenji is "thinking about his regrets." We
                can't photograph thoughts. We can only photograph action.</p>

            <h3>The Logline</h3>
            <p>A logline is a single sentence that captures the protagonist, goal, conflict, and stakes. This concise
                statement forms the “hook” for the story.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A timid girl must navigate a mysterious spirit world to rescue her
                            parents and reclaim her identity—or risk being forgotten forever.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Thirteen warriors must assassinate a sadistic lord protected by the
                            state, knowing their mission could spark a civil war—but also restore justice to a corrupt
                            empire.</p>

                        <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: #fff;">Your Name</strong>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">When a city boy and a rural girl begin switching bodies, they must
                            find a way to meet before time—and memory—erases their connection forever.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>1.3.2 Narrative Structure</h2>

            <p>Almost every story ever told can be boiled down to three elements:</p>

            <div
                style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.4rem; font-family: var(--font-heading); color: var(--accent-neon-cyan); border: 1px solid var(--accent-neon-cyan); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; background: rgba(0, 243, 255, 0.05);">
                One Protagonist. One Goal. A whole bunch of Obstacles.
            </div>

            <p>While experimental films exist, the vast majority of cinema follows the <strong>Three-Act
                    Structure</strong>. This isn't a "rule" enforced by some Hollywood police force. It's simply a
                pattern that works for human psychology. We like setups, confrontations, and resolutions.</p>

                    The Story Circle</h5>
                <p>Dan Harmon's Story Circle is a tool for mapping a character's journey through change. Whether in the
                    violent chaos of <em>Kubi</em> or the quiet coming-of-age in <em>Initial D</em>, this structure
                    reveals how characters evolve.</p>

                <p><strong>1. You — Establishing the Ordinary World</strong><br>
                    <em>Kubi</em>: The film opens in a volatile yet eerily ordered court. Nobunaga sits atop a delicate
                    power structure held together by fear.<br>
                    <em>Initial D</em>: Takumi lives in quiet monotony, delivering tofu before dawn. His world is
                    constrained, familiar, and disconnected.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. Need — Highlighting the Desire or Problem</strong><br>
                    <em>Kubi</em>: Nobunaga's unchecked ambition has created enemies on all sides.<br>
                    <em>Initial D</em>: Takumi's need is buried under passivity. The challenge of racing awakens
                    something dormant.
                </p>

                <p><strong>3. Go — Crossing into the Unfamiliar</strong><br>
                    <em>Initial D</em>: Takumi agrees to his first official race. This moment thrusts him into a
                    subculture he never sought.

            <h3>The Plot Points</h3>
            <p>To keep a story moving, screenwriters use specific structural beats. If you look at the timecode of your
                favorite blockbuster, you will likely find these moments hitting at the exact same minute marks.</p>

            <h3>The Anti-Hero</h3>
            <p>Sometimes the most compelling protagonist isn't a "good guy." An <strong>Anti-Hero</strong> lacks
                traditional heroic qualities like idealism or courage. They might be selfish, cynical, or even criminal.
            </p>
            <p>Think of Light Yagami in <em>Death Note</em>. He is a mass murderer. He has a god complex. Yet he is the
                protagonist. We are glued to the screen not because we agree with him, but because we want to see
                <em>what he does next</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>1.3.4 Narration and Point of View</h2>

            <p>Who is telling the story?</p>
            <p>In literature, you have "First Person" (I went to the store) or "Third Person" (He went to the store). In
                film, the primary narrator is always the <strong>Camera</strong>.</p>
            <p>The camera decides what we see. And more importantly, what we <em>don't</em> see.</p>

            <h3>The Unreliable Narrator</h3>
            <p>Normally we assume the camera tells the truth. If we see a character walk into a room, they walked into a
                room. But what if the narrator is lying?</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div class="video-wrapper">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18M6k_yO8iQ" title="Rashomon Effect"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The classic example is Akira Kurosawa's <strong><em>Rashomon</em></strong> (1950). A samurai is murdered.
                Four witnesses testify: the bandit, the wife, the woodcutter, and even the ghost of the samurai himself.
                Each story contradicts the others. Each narrator paints themselves in a better light. We never learn the
                "objective" truth. We only learn that truth is subjective.</p>
            <p>A modern Tokyo equivalent is Satoshi Kon's <strong><em>Perfect Blue</em></strong> (1997), where the
                protagonist's fracturing sanity makes the camera itself unreliable. Are those fans really there? Is she
                seeing a ghost? Or is she just losing her mind?</p>

            <h2>1.3.5 Time: Story vs. Plot</h2>

            <p>It is crucial to distinguish between two concepts that are often used interchangeably:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Story:</strong> The chronological sequence of events. (A -> B -> C -> D)</li>
                <li><strong>Plot:</strong> The order in which the audience sees them. (C -> A -> B -> D)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A film like <em>Pulp Fiction</em> has a simple story but a complex, scrambled plot. In Tokyo cinema,
                <strong><em>The Tatami Galaxy</em></strong> (2010) takes this to the extreme. The protagonist relives
                his college years over and over, trying to find the "rose-colored" campus life. The Story events
                (meeting Ozu, joining a club) repeat, but the Plot is a spiral, showing us variations until the
                character finally breaks the loop.

            <h2>1.3.6 Genre</h2>

            <p>Genre is simply a way to categorize stories based on shared elements. It helps audiences know what they
                are buying a ticket for, and it helps producers sell those tickets.</p>

            <p class="lead" style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;"><strong>Story (Action) + Plot + Character +
                    Setting = Genre</strong></p>

            <p>If you have a Sheriff (Character) in a dusty town (Setting) facing a duel (Action) to restore order
                (Plot), you have a <strong>Western</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you have a Detective (Character) in a rainy city (Setting) solving a murder (Action) where everyone is
                corrupt (Plot), you have <strong>Film Noir</strong>.</p>
