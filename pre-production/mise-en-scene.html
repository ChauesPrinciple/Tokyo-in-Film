            <p>Allow me to introduce a word destined to impress your friends and family when you trot it out at the next
                cocktail party: <strong>Mise-en-Scè¨ne</strong>. And even if you don'€™t frequent erudite cocktail
                parties,
                and who does these days (a shame), it'€™s still a handy term to have around. It'€™s French (obviously),
                and
                it literally means '€œputting on stage.'€</p>

            <p>Why French? Sometimes, we like to feel fancy, and let'€™s face it: to an American, French is fancy.</p>

            <p>But the idea is simple. Borrowed from theater, it refers to every element in the frame that contributes
                to the overall look of a film. And I mean everything: set design, costume, hair, make-up, color scheme,
                framing, composition, lighting'€¦ Basically, if you can see it, it contributes to the mise-en-scè¨ne.
            </p>

            <p>I could have started with any number of different tools or techniques filmmakers use to create a
                cinematic experience. The narrative might seem a more obvious starting point. Cinema can'€™t exist
                without
                a story; chronologically speaking, it all starts with the screenplay. Or I could have led off with
                cinematography. After all, we often think of cinema as a <em>visual</em> medium. But mise-en-scè¨ne
                captures much more than any one tool or technique in isolation. It'€™s more an aesthetic context in
                which
                everything else takes place, the unifying look, or even <em>feel</em>, of a film or series.</p>

            <p>And this is probably as good a time as any to discuss the role of a <strong>director</strong> in cinema.
                There'€™s a school of thought out there, known as the <strong>auteur theory</strong>, that claims the
                director is the '€œauthor'€ of a work of cinema, not unlike the author of a novel, and that they alone
                are
                ultimately responsible for what we see on the screen. Cinema requires dozens, if not hundreds, of
                professionals dedicated to bringing a story to life. The screenwriter writes the script, the production
                designer designs the sets, the cinematographer photographs the scenes, the sound crew captures the
                sound, the editor connects the shots together, and each of them has whole teams of experts working below
                them to make it all work on screen. But if there'€™s any hope of that final product having a unified
                aesthetic and a coherent, underlying theme that ties it all together, it needs a singular vision to give
                it <em>direction</em>. That, really, is the job of a director. To ensure everyone is moving in the same
                direction, making the same work of art. And they do that not so much by managing people '€“ they have an
                <strong>assistant director</strong> and producers for that '€“ they do it by managing mise-en-scè¨ne,
                shaping the overall look and feel of the final product. While mise-en-scè¨ne has many moving parts and
                many different professionals in charge of shaping those individual parts into something coherent, it'€™s
                the one element of cinema that is most clearly the responsibility of the director.
            </p>

            <p>This talent for shaping mise-en-scè¨ne is one reason we can readily identify great directors' work. Think
                about the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Agnes Varda, Wes Anderson, Yosujiro Ozu, Claire Denis, or Steven
                Speilberg (and if some of those names are unfamiliar, seek them out!). If we know their work at all,
                most of us could pick out one of their films after just a few minutes, even if we had never seen it
                before. This is not just because of some signature flourish or idiosyncratic visual habit (though
                that'€™s
                often part of it) but because their films have a certain look to them, a certain aesthetic that
                saturates the screen.</p>

            <p>Take the films of Claire Denis, for example:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmKsEaURJog"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Denis'€™s films generate an enveloping atmosphere that you can almost taste and feel, and all of that is
                part of her consistent (and brilliant) use of mise-en-scè¨ne.</p>

            <p>Or how about the films of Wes Anderson:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/113976887"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Anderson'€™s films consistently use symmetrical compositions, smooth, precise tracking shots, and slow
                motion, but it'€™s the overall effect, the mise-en-scè¨ne that makes the impression (check out more
                break-downs of Wes Anderson'€™s style <a href="https://youtu.be/ba3c9KEuQ4A">here</a> and <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/q45m7RYy7-4">here</a>).</p>

            <p>Because mise-en-scè¨ne refers to this '€œoverall look,'€ it can feel rather broad (and even vague) as a
                concept. So, let'€™s break it down into four elements of design: <strong>setting</strong>,
                <strong>character</strong>, <strong>lighting</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>. We'€™ll tackle
                each one in turn.
            </p>



            <h2>1.3.1 Setting</h2>

            <p>Nothing we see on the screen in the cinema is there by accident. Everything is carefully planned,
                arranged, and even fabricated '€“ sometimes using computer-generated imagery (CGI) '€“ to serve the
                story
                and create a unified aesthetic.</p>

            <p>That goes double for the setting.</p>

            <p>If mise-en-scè¨ne is the overall aesthetic context for a film or series, the setting is the
                <em>literal</em> context, the space actors and objects inhabit for every scene. And this is much more
                than simply the location. It'€™s how that location, whether it'€™s an existing space occupied for
                filming or
                one purpose-built on a soundstage, is <em>designed</em> to serve the vision of the director.
            </p>

            <p>As we saw in Chapter One, in the early days of motion pictures, when cinematic language was still in its
                infancy, not much thought was given to the design of a setting (or editing or performance, and no one
                was even thinking about sound yet). But it didn'€™t take long for filmmakers to realize they could
                employ
                the same tricks of set design they used in theater for the cinema.</p>

            <p>One of the pioneers of this was the French filmmaker Georges Mè©liè¨s. Take, for example, his 1903 film
                <em>The Kingdom of the Fairies</em>:
            </p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AfmH7WyWXg8"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Mè©liè¨s'€™s use of elaborate sets, along with equally elaborate costumes, hairstyles, make-up, and even
                the
                hand-tinting of the film itself, all contribute to the fantastical look and feel of the film. He brought
                a similar design sensibility to all of his films, including the ground-breaking 1902 film <em>A Trip to
                    the Moon</em>.</p>

            <p>A decade or so later, this attention to detail in the design elements of cinema had become commonplace.
                Indeed, many of the more well-known early silent films are famous for their sophisticated
                mise-en-scè¨ne,
                particularly in regard to setting, often above all else.</p>

            <p>Check out this scene again from D. W. Griffith'€™s <em>Intolerance</em> (1916):</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lg9REHb9en8"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The set design alone is staggering. Built in the middle of Los Angeles, it took four years to dismantle
                it.</p>

            <p>Or consider the opening of Fritz Lang'€™s <em>Metropolis</em> (1927):</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mK46KprASM"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The film draws us into a mechanized, dystopian future '€“ one of the first science-fiction films in
                history
                '€“ and its success lies in its careful design of the setting to serve that narrative purpose.</p>

            <p>Once filmmakers realized the importance of setting as an element of design and what it contributed to the
                overall look of their films, it wasn'€™t long before a position was created to oversee it all: the
                <strong>production designer</strong>. The production designer is the point person for the overall
                aesthetic design of a film or series. Working closely with the director, they help translate the
                aesthetic vision for the project '€“ its mise-en-scè¨ne '€“ to the various design departments, including
                set
                design, art department, costume, hair, and make-up. But arguably, their most important job is to make
                sure the <em>setting</em> matches that aesthetic vision, specifically through <strong>set
                    design</strong> and <strong>set decoration</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Set design is precisely what it sounds like '€“ the design and construction of the setting for any given
                scene in a film or series. Plenty of productions use existing locations and don'€™t necessarily have to
                build much of anything (though that doesn'€™t mean there isn'€™t an element of design involved, as we
                shall
                see). But when production requires complete control over the filming environment, production designers,
                along with conceptual artists, construction engineers, and sometimes a whole army of artisans, must
                create each setting, or <strong>set</strong>, from the ground up. And since these sets have to hold up
                under the strain of a large film crew working in and around them for days and even weeks, they require
                as much planning and careful construction as any real-life home, building, or interplanetary city out
                there.</p>

            <p>Take a look at the incredible detail involved in bringing the set design to life for <em>Thor:
                    Ragnarok</em> (Taika Waititi, 2017):</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PWn3Lu_Q78"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>D. W. Griffith can take a seat.</p>

            <p>These sets may be built on-site to blend in with the surrounding landscape, or they may be built within a
                large, windowless, sound-proof building called a <strong>soundstage</strong>. A soundstage provides the
                control over the environment production designers need to give the director precisely the look and feel
                she wants from a particular scene. On a big enough soundstage, a production designer can fabricate
                interiors and exteriors, sections of buildings, and even small villages. And since it is all shielded
                from the outside, the production has complete control over lighting and sound. It can be dawn or
                twilight for 12 hours a day. And a shot will never be interrupted by an airplane flying loudly overhead.
            </p>

            <p>The use of soundstages is particularly helpful when producing serialized content. A TV or streaming
                series, especially one that uses the same few locations over and over '€“ the family home, the
                mobster'€™s
                headquarters, the king'€™s palace '€“ needs access to those sets for months at a time, year after year,
                for
                as long as we keep watching. Of all those series you binge-watch on the weekends (or during the week
                when you should be reading this), almost all of them depend upon sets built from the ground up and
                housed on soundstages for years on end.</p>

            <p>Of course, sometimes, the setting of a particular production requires more than a production designer can
                deliver with the materials available (or the time or the budget, as the case may be). In that case, the
                setting must be augmented with <strong>computer-generated imagery</strong> (CGI). The most common way
                this is implemented is through the use of <strong>green screen technology</strong>. The idea is fairly
                simple. The set is dressed with a backdrop of bright green (or blue; the actual color isn'€™t terribly
                important), and the scene is filmed as usual. Then, in post-production, the software picks out that
                particular color and replaces it with imagery either filmed elsewhere or generated by digital artists, a
                process called <strong>keying</strong>. For this to work, no other object or article of clothing can
                match that shade of green, or it will be replaced as well. And with ever-improving technology, the sky
                is no longer the limit to what designers can offer up for the screen.</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rk0279i7vM"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Whether the production designer is building the set from the ground up on a soundstage or simply using an
                existing location, the setting is still a kind of blank canvas until that space is filled with all of
                the essential details that really tell the story. That'€™s where set <em>design</em> meets set
                <em>decoration</em>. Still under the supervision of the production designer, set decorating falls to any
                number of skilled artisans in the <strong>art department</strong>. They design everything from the color
                on the walls, to the texture of the drapes, to the style of the furniture, to every ashtray, book, and
                family photo that might show up on screen. And that goes for existing locations as well. A film
                production using someone'€™s actual home for a scene will likely replace all of the furniture, repaint
                the
                walls, and fill it with their own odds and ends that help tell the cinematic story. And then, hopefully,
                put it all back the way they found it when they'€™re done.
            </p>

            <p>For example, in <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</em>, color is used strategically to signal danger.
                As student Grace Ochoa notes regarding the set decoration:</p>

            <blockquote class="student-quote">
                <p>In almost every frame you can see at least one red object in the background. Most of us know the
                    color red often signals a sign of danger. The use of red signals to us that the conflict between
                    both groups is escalating to a dangerous, and fatal, point.</p>

            <p>Take a look at the ways the production designer for the Netflix series <em>The Crown</em> converts
                existing locations into a Buckingham Palace throne room or the Queen'€™s private apartment:</p>

            <p>This is where storytelling through the physical environment '€“ the setting '€“ can really come alive.
                Every
                object placed just so on a set adds to the mise-en-scè¨ne and helps tell the story. Those objects could
                be in the background providing context '€“ framed photos, a trophy, an antique clock '€“ or they could
                be
                picked up and handled by characters in a scene '€“ a glass of whisky, a pack of cigarettes, a loaded
                gun.
                We even have a name for those objects, <strong>props</strong>, short for '€œproperty'€ and also
                borrowed
                from theater, and a name for the person in charge of keeping track of them all, a <strong>prop
                    master</strong>.</p>

            <p>As should be clear by now, setting is one of the most important design elements in creating a consistent
                mise-en-scè¨ne. Not simply the location '€“ a suburban home, a high-rise office building, a spaceport on
                Mos Eisley '€“ but all of the details that fill that location, make it come alive as a lived-in space,
                and
                most importantly, help tell the cinematic story. One way we can begin to see the filmmaker's intention,
                to understand how she is subtly (and maybe not so subtly) manipulating our emotions through cinematic
                language, is to pay attention to these details. The very details we'€™re <em>not</em> supposed to
                notice.
            </p>



            <h2>1.3.2 Character</h2>

            <p><strong>Character</strong> is a term that will come up a lot. We use it to describe how a screenwriter
                invents believable characters that inhabit a narrative structure. And we use it to describe how an actor
                inhabits that character in their performance. But we can also examine how the physical <em>design</em>
                of a character, through costume, make-up, and hairstyle, not only contributes to the mise-en-scè¨ne but
                also helps fully realize the work of both screenwriters and actors.</p>

            <p>Typically, when we think of '€œcharacter design,'€ we might immediately think of fantastic creatures
                dreamed
                up in a special effects studio. They might be animated through CGI, fabricated from latex, and worn by
                an actor. And all of that is a reasonable way to think about the concept of character design. But in
                some ways, that is just a much more extreme version of how I would like to frame the work of costume
                designers and hair and make-up professionals.</p>

            <p>Just as a screenwriter must create '€“ or design '€“ a character on the page and an actor must create '€“
                or
                design '€“ their approach to inhabiting that character, the wardrobe, hair, and make-up departments must
                also <em>design</em> how that character is going to look on screen. This design element is, of course,
                more obvious the less familiar the world of the character might be. The clothing, hair, and make-up of
                characters inhabiting worlds in a distant time period or even more distant galaxy will inevitably draw
                our attention. (Though even there, the intention is to add to the mise-en-scè¨ne without distracting us
                from the story.) But even when the context is closer to home, a story set in our time, in our culture,
                maybe even our own hometown, every element of the clothes, the hair, and the make-up is carefully
                chosen, sometimes made from scratch, to fit that context and those particular characters. In other
                words, each character'€™s look is carefully <em>designed</em> to support the overall mise-en-scè¨ne and
                help tell the story.</p>

            <p>Take costume design, for example. We often think of '€œcostume'€ as another word for disguise or playing
                a
                character. But the last thing a filmmaker wants is for the audience to think of their characters as
                actors in disguise or playing dress-up. They want us to see the characters. Period. The wardrobe should
                fit the time, place, and, most importantly, the character. Once that is established, the designer can
                layer in more subtle hints about the larger context, the underlying theme, by adding a touch of color
                that serves as a visual motif or introducing some alteration in the wardrobe that dramatizes some
                narrative shift:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gRAmIaSlm80"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>What is important to note is that costume design in film is not about fashion or what looks '€œgood'€ on
                an
                actor. It'€™s about what looks <em>right </em>on a character, what fits the setting, and the film's
                overall look.</p>

            <p>These same principles can be applied to hair and make-up. As with costume design, it'€™s easy to think of
                the more extreme examples of hair and make-up design, especially when the setting calls for something
                historic, other-worldly, or'€¦ horrifying. The special effects make-up for the gory bits of your
                favorite
                horror films can sometimes take center stage. But these elements are often not meant to draw our
                attention at all. To achieve that, perhaps ironically, hair and make-up require even more attention from
                their respective designers. This is due in part to the technical requirements of filming. Bright lights
                can reveal every distracting blemish or poorly applied foundation, and as camera and image technology
                improves, the techniques required to hide the fact that actors are even wearing make-up must be
                continually refined. But it is also because hair and make-up are incredibly personal and intimately
                connected to the character:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYOcJf9PLq4"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>And while all of this is tremendously important for the audience, it is even more important for the actor
                playing the character. We'€™ll discuss the various ways an actor approaches their performance in detail
                in
                another chapter, but for now, it'€™s important to note how much actors rely upon the <em>design</em> of
                their character through costume, hair, and make-up. Putting on the wardrobe, seeing themselves in
                another era, a different hairstyle, looking older or younger, helps the actor literally and
                metaphorically step into the life of someone else and do so believably enough that we no longer see the
                actor, only the character in the story.</p>



            <h2>1.3.3 Lighting</h2>

            <p>The first two elements of design in mise-en-scè¨ne '€“ setting and character '€“ fall squarely under the
                supervision of the production designer and the art department. The next two '€“ lighting and composition
                '€“
                fall to the <strong>cinematographer</strong> and the camera department but are just as important as
                elements of design in the overall look of the film. We will take a deeper dive into each in a later
                chapter on cinematography, but for now, let'€™s take a quick look at how these elements fit into
                mise-en-scè¨ne.</p>

            <p>As should be obvious, you can'€™t have a cinema without light. Light exposes the image and, of course,
                allows us to see it. But it'€™s the creative use of light, or <strong>lighting</strong>, that makes it
                an
                element design. A cinematographer can illuminate a given scene with <strong>practical light</strong>,
                that is, light from lamps and other fixtures that are part of the set design, <strong>set
                    lights</strong>, light fixtures that are off-camera and specifically designed to light a film set,
                or even <strong>available light</strong>, light from the sun or whatever permanent fixtures are at a
                given location. But in each case, the cinematographer is not simply throwing a light switch; they are
                <em>shaping</em> that light, making it work for the scene and the story as a whole. They do this by
                emphasizing different aspects of lighting direction and intensity. A <strong>key light</strong>, for
                example, is the primary light that illuminates a subject. A <strong>fill light</strong> fills out the
                shadows a strong key light might create. And a <strong>backlight</strong> helps separate the subject
                from the background. And it'€™s the consistent use of a particular lighting design that makes it a
                powerful part of mise-en-scè¨ne.
            </p>

            <p>Two basic approaches to lighting style can illustrate the point. <strong>Low-key lighting</strong> refers
                to a lighting design where the key light remains subtle and even subordinate to other lighting sources.
                The result? A high-contrast lighting design that makes consistent use of harsh shadows. Another word for
                this is <strong>chiaroscuro lighting</strong> (this time, we'€™re stealing a fancy word from Italian).
                Think of old detective movies with the private eye stalking around the dark streets of San Francisco.
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <img src="../assets/big-combo.jpg" alt="The Big Combo, 1955, Joseph H. Lewis, dir."
                    style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Classic low-key lighting.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>High-key lighting</strong> refers to a lighting design where the key light remains the dominant
                source, resulting in a low-contrast, even flat, or washed-out look to the image. Think of art-house
                dramas set in stark, snowy landscapes or even big Hollywood comedies that try to avoid '€œinteresting'€
                shadows that might distract us from the joke.</p>

            <p>In either case, the cinematographer, working closely with the director and production designer, is using
                light as an element of design, contributing to the overall mise-en-scè¨ne.</p>



            <h2>1.3.4 Composition</h2>

            <p>The fourth and final design element in considering mise-en-scè¨ne '€“ one that I touched on in the last
                chapter and will receive much more attention in the chapter on cinematography '€“ is composition. As
                discussed in Chapter Two, composition refers to the arrangement of people, objects, and settings within
                the frame of an image. And because we are talking about <em>moving</em> pictures, there are really two
                important components of composition: framing, which even photographers must master, and movement. In the
                case of cinematic composition, movement refers to movement within the frame as well as movement of the
                frame as the cinematographer moves the camera through the scene. All of which are critical aspects of
                how we experience mise-en-scè¨ne.</p>

            <p>Like lighting, composition falls under the responsibility of the cinematographer. While there are many
                technical and artistic considerations when it comes to framing and movement, cinematographers are also
                keenly aware of the design element of composition. In fact, they often describe at least part of their
                job as <em>designing</em> a shot. Part of this process involves arranging people, objects, and settings
                in the frame to achieve a sense of balance and proportion, often dividing the frame into thirds
                horizontally and vertically to ensure proper distribution. We call this the <strong>rule of
                    thirds</strong>, and it'€™s fairly common in photography. In fact, take out your phone right now,
                open
                the camera app, and you'€™re likely to see a faint grid across the screen. That'€™s there to help you
                balance the composition of your selfie according to the rule of thirds. Another important part of the
                process of designing a shot is the choreography involved in moving the camera through the scene, whether
                on wheels, on a crane, or strapped to a camera person.</p>

            <p>Again, we'€™ll spend more time on this subject in a later chapter, but take a look at how Japanese
                filmmaker Akira Kurosawa approaches the composition of movement in designing his shots:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/doaQC-S8de8"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Or how Andrea Arnold uses framing and composition to communicate isolation, captivity, or a deep
                connection to the earth:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget">
                <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aG4jUVsSzXw"
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>A thoughtfully composed frame does more than create a pleasing image. It can isolate characters, focus
                our attention, and draw us into the story without us ever really noticing the technique itself.</p>

            <p>Unless we know to look for it.</p>
