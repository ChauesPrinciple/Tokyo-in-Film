                <p class="lead">In this course, you will work in self-selected teams of three to create a 2 to 8-minute
                    short film. At the heart of this project is a deeper appreciation of film and its connection to
                    Tokyo.</p>
                <p>You will recreate, adapt, or craft a new scene inspired by the films we analyze, using Tokyo as your
                    creative playground. This process isn’t about technical mastery. It’s about embracing the art of
                    experimentation, playing with storytelling techniques, and finding your own voice within the world
                    of cinema. By engaging with these films, you’ll explore how they capture the essence of Tokyo, not
                    just as a backdrop, but as a character within each story.</p>
